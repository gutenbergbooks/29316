<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><i>PREFACE</i></h2>


<p>In literature there have been romantic pirates,
gentlemanly pirates, kind-hearted pirates, even humorous
pirates&mdash;in fact, all sorts and conditions of
pirates. In life there was only one kind. In this
book that kind appears. Several presentations&mdash;in
the guise of novels&mdash;of pirates, the like of which
never existed on land or sea, have recently appeared.
A perusal of these interesting romances
awoke in me a desire to write a story of a real pirate,
a pirate of the genuine species.</p>

<p>Much research for historical essays, amid ancient
records and moldy chronicles, put me in possession
of a vast amount of information concerning the
doings of the greatest of all pirates; a man unique
among his nefarious brethren, in that he played the
piratical game so successfully that he received the
honor of knighthood from King Charles II. A
belted knight of England, who was also a brutal,
rapacious, lustful, murderous villain and robber&mdash;and
undoubtedly a pirate, although he disguised his
piracy under the name of buccaneering&mdash;is certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>a striking and unusual figure.</p>

<p>Therefore, when I imagined my pirate story I
pitched upon Sir Henry Morgan as <i>the</i> character of
the romance. It will spare the critic to admit that
the tale hereinafter related is a work of the imagination,
and is not an historical romance. According
to the latest accounts, Sir Henry Morgan, by a
singular oversight of Fate, who must have been
nodding at the time, died in his bed&mdash;not peacefully
I trust&mdash;and was buried in consecrated ground.
But I do him no injustice, I hasten to assure
the reader, in the acts that I have attributed to
him, for they are more than paralleled by the well
authenticated deeds of this human monster. I did
not even invent the blowing up of the English frigate
in the action with the Spanish ships.</p>

<p>If I have assumed for the nonce the attributes
of that unaccountably somnolent Fate, and brought
him to a terrible end, I am sure abundant justification
will be found in the recital of his mythical misdeeds,
which, I repeat, were not a circumstance to
his real transgressions. Indeed, one has to go back
to the most cruel and degenerate of the Roman
emperors to parallel the wickednesses of Morgan
and his men. It is not possible to put upon printed
pages explicit statements of what they did. The
curious reader may find some account of these
"Gentlemen of the Black Flag," so far as it can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
be translated into present-day books intended for
popular reading, in my volume of "<span class="smcap">Colonial Fights
and Fighters</span>."</p>

<p>The writing of this novel has been by no means
an easy task. How to convey clearly the doings of
the buccaneer so there could be no misapprehension
on the part of the reader, and yet to write with due
delicacy and restraint a book for the general public,
has been a problem with which I have wrestled long
and arduously. The whole book has been completely
revised some six times. Each time I have
deleted something, which, while it has refined, I
trust has not impaired the strength of the tale. If
the critic still find things to censure, let him pass
over charitably in view of what might have been!</p>

<p>As to the other characters, I have done violence
to the name and fame of no man, for all of those
who played any prominent part among the buccaneers
in the story were themselves men scarcely
less criminal than Morgan. Be it known that I
have simply appropriated names, not careers. They
all had adventures of their own and were not associated
with Morgan in life. Teach&mdash;I have a weakness
for that bad young man&mdash;is known to history as
"Blackbeard"&mdash;a much worse man than the roaring
singer of these pages. The delectable Hornigold,
the One-Eyed, with the "wild justice" of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
revenge, was another real pirate. So was the faithful
Black Dog, the maroon. So were Raveneau de
Lussan, Rock Braziliano, L'Ollonois, Velsers, Sawkins,
and the rest.</p>

<p>In addition to my desire to write a real story of
a real pirate I was actuated by another intent. There
are numberless tales of the brave days of the Spanish
Main, from "Westward Ho!" down. In every
one of them, without exception, the hero is a noble,
gallant, high-souled, high-spirited, valiant descendant
of the Anglo-Saxon race, while the villain&mdash;and
such villains they are!&mdash;is always a proud and
haughty Spaniard, who comes to grief dreadfully
in the final trial which determines the issue. My
sympathies, from a long course of reading of such
romances, have gone out to the under Don. I determined
to write a story with a Spanish gentleman
for the hero, and a Spanish gentlewoman for the
heroine, and let the position of villain be filled by
one of our own race. Such things were, and here
they are. I have dwelt with pleasure on the love
affairs of the gallant Alvarado and the beautiful
Mercedes.</p>

<p>But, after all, the story is pre&euml;minently the story
of Morgan. I have striven to make it a character
sketch of that remarkable personality. I wished to
portray his ferocity and cruelty, his brutality and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
wantonness, his treachery and rapacity; to exhibit,
without lightening, the dark shadows of his character,
and to depict his inevitable and utter breakdown
finally; yet at the same time to bring out his dauntless
courage, his military ability, his fertility and
resourcefulness, his mastery of his men, his capacity
as a seaman, which are qualities worthy of admiration.
Yet I have not intended to make him an
admirable figure. To do that would be to falsify
history and disregard the artistic canons. So I have
tried to show him as he was; great and brave, small
and mean, skilful and able, greedy and cruel; and
lastly, in his crimes and punishment, a coward.</p>

<p>And if a mere romance may have a lesson, here
in this tale is one of a just retribution, exhibited in
the awful, if adequate, vengeance finally wreaked
upon Morgan by those whom he had so fearfully and
dreadfully wronged.</p>

<p class="center">WHEREIN SIR HENRY MORGAN MADE GOOD USE OF THE TEN
MINUTES ALLOWED HIM</p>

<p>is Gracious Majesty, King Charles II. of
England, in sportive&mdash;and acquisitive&mdash;mood,
had made him a knight; but, as
that merry monarch himself had said of
another unworthy subject
whom he had ennobled&mdash;his
son, by the
left hand&mdash;"God Almighty
could not make
him a gentleman!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/002.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Yet, to the casual inspection,
little or nothing
appeared to be lacking
to entitle him to all the
consideration attendant
upon that ancient degree. His attire, for instance,
might be a year or two behind the fashion of Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>land
and still further away from that of France,
then, as now, the standard maker in dress, yet it
represented the extreme of the mode in His Majesty's
fair island of Jamaica. That it was a trifle
too vivid in its colors, and too striking in its contrasts
for the best taste at home, possibly might
be condoned by the richness of the material used
and the prodigality of trimming which decorated
it. Silk and satin from the Orient, lace from
Flanders, leather from Spain, with jewels from
everywhere, marked him as a person entitled to
some consideration, at least. Even more compulsory
of attention, if not of respect, were his
haughty, overbearing, satisfied manner, his look of
command, the expression of authority in action he
bore.</p>

<p>Quite in keeping with his gorgeous appearance
was the richly furnished room in which he sat in
autocratic isolation, plumed hat on head, quaffing,
as became a former brother-of-the-coast and sometime
buccaneer, amazing draughts of the fiery spirits
of the island of which he happened to be, <i>ad interim</i>,
the Royal Authority.</p>

<p>But it was his face which attested the acuteness
of the sneering observation of the unworthy giver
of the royal accolade. No gentleman ever bore face
like that. Framed in long, thin, gray curls which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
fell upon his shoulders after the fashion of the time,
it was as cruel, as evil, as sensuous, as ruthless, as
powerful an old face as had ever looked over a bulwark
at a sinking ship, or viewed with indifference
the ravaging of a devoted town. Courage there
was, capacity in large measure, but not one trace of
human kindness. Thin, lean, hawk-like, ruthless,
cunning, weather-beaten, it was sadly out of place
in its brave attire in that vaulted chamber. It was
the face of a man who ruled by terror; who commanded
by might. It was the face of an adventurer,
too, one never sure of his position, but always
ready to fight for it, and able to fight well. There
was a watchful, alert, inquiring look in the fierce
blue eyes, an intent, expectant expression in the
craggy countenance, that told of the uncertainties
of his assumptions; yet the lack of assurance was
compensated for by the firm, resolute line of the
mouth under the trifling upturned mustache, with
its lips at the same time thin and sensual. To be
fat and sensual is to appear to mitigate the latter
evil with at least a pretence at good humor; to be
thin and sensual is to be a devil. This man was
evil, not with the grossness of a debauchee but with
the thinness of the devotee. And he was an old
man, too. Sixty odd years of vicious life, glossed
over in the last two decades by an assumption of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
respectability, had swept over the gray hairs, which
evoked no reverence.</p>

<p>There was a heavy frown on his face on that summer
evening in the year of our Lord, 1685. The
childless wife whom he had taken for his betterment
and her worsening, some ten years since&mdash;in succession
to Satan only knew how many nameless, unrecognized
precursors&mdash;had died a few moments
before, in the chamber above his head. Fairly
bought from a needy father, she had been a cloak
to lend him a certain respectability when he settled
down, red with the blood of thousands whom he
had slain and rich with the treasure of cities that he
had wasted, to enjoy the evening of his life. Like
all who are used for such purposes, she knew, after
a little space, the man over whom the mantle of her
reputation had been flung. She had rejoiced at the
near approach of that death for which she had been
longing almost since her wedding day. That she had
shrunk from him in the very articles of dissolution
when he stood by her bedside, indicated the character
of the relationship.</p>

<p>To witness death and to cause it had been the
habit of this man. He marked it in her case, as in
others, with absolute indifference&mdash;he cared so little
for her that he did not even feel relief at her going&mdash;yet
because he was the Governor of Jamaica<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
(really he was only the Vice-Governor, but between
the departure of the Royal Governor and the arrival
of another he held supreme power) he had been
forced to keep himself close on the day his wife
died, by that public opinion to which he was indifferent
but which he could not entirely defy. Consequently
he had not been on the strand at Port
Royal when the <i>Mary Rose</i>, frigate, fresh from
England, had dropped anchor in the harbor after
her weary voyage across the great sea. He did not
even yet know of her arrival, and therefore the incoming
Governor had not been welcomed by the
man who sat temporarily, as he had in several preceding
interregnums, in the seats of the mighty.</p>

<p>However, everybody else on the island had welcomed
him with joy, for of all men who had ever
held office in Jamaica Sir Henry Morgan, sometime
the chief devil of those nefarious bands who disguised
their piracy under the specious title of buccaneering,
was the most detested. But because of
the fortunate demise of Lady Morgan, as it turned
out, Sir Henry was not present to greet My Lord
Carlingford, who was to supersede him&mdash;and more.</p>

<p>The deep potations the old buccaneer had indulged
in to all outward intent passed harmlessly
down his lean and craggy throat. He drank alone&mdash;the
more solitary the drinker the more dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the man&mdash;yet the room had another occupant, a tall,
brawny, brown-hued, grim-faced savage, whose
gaudy livery ill accorded with his stern and ruthless
visage. He stood by the Vice-Governor, watchful,
attentive, and silent, imperturbably filling again
and again the goblet from which he drank.</p>

<p>"More rum," said the master, at last breaking
the silence while lifting his tall glass toward the
man. "Scuttle me, Black Dog," he added, smiling
sardonically at the silent maroon who poured
again with steady hand, "you are the only soul on
this island who doesn't fear me. That woman
above yonder, curse her, shuddered away from me as
I looked at her dying. But your hand is steady.
You and old Ben Hornigold are the only ones who
don't shrink back, hey, Carib? Is it love or hate?"
he mused, as the man made no answer. "More,"
he cried, again lifting the glass which he had instantly
drained.</p>

<p>But the maroon, instead of pouring, bent his head
toward the window, listened a moment, and then
turned and lifted a warning hand. The soft breeze
of the evening, laden with the fragrance of the
tropics, swept up from the river and wafted to the
Vice-Governor's ears the sound of hoof beats on the
hard, dry road. With senses keenly alert, he, also,
listened. There were a number of them, a troop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
possibly. They were drawing nearer; they were
coming toward his house, the slimmer house near
Spanish Town, far up on the mountain side, where
he sought relief from the enervating heats of the
lower land.</p>

<p>"Horsemen!" he cried. "Coming to the house!
Many of them! Ah, they dismount. Go to the
door, Carib."</p>

<p>But before the maroon could obey they heard steps
on the porch. Some one entered the hall. The
door of the drawing-room was abruptly thrown
open, and two men in the uniform of the English
army, with the distinguishing marks of the Governor's
Guard at Jamaica, unceremoniously entered
the room. They were fully armed. One of them,
the second, had drawn his sword and held a cocked
pistol in the other hand. The first, whose weapons
were still in their sheaths, carried a long official
paper with a portentous seal dangling from it.
Both were booted and spurred and dusty from riding,
and both, contrary to the custom and etiquette
of the island, kept their plumed hats on their heads.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry Morgan&mdash;&mdash;" began the bearer of
the paper.</p>

<p>"By your leave, gentlemen," interrupted Morgan,
with an imperious wave of his hand, "Lieutenant
Hawxherst and Ensign Bradley of my guard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
I believe. You will uncover at once and apologize
for having entered so unceremoniously."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the Governor rose to his feet and
stood by the table, his right hand unconsciously
resting upon the heavy glass flagon of rum. He
towered above the other two men as he stood there
transfixing them with his resentful glance, his brow
heavy with threat and anger. But the two soldiers
made no movement toward complying with the
admonition of their sometime superior.</p>

<p>"D'ye hear me?" he cried, stepping forward,
reddening with rage at their apparent contumacy.
"And bethink ye, sirs, had best address me, who
stand in the place of the King's Majesty, as 'Your
Excellency,' or I'll have you broke, knaves."</p>

<p>"We need no lessons in manners from you, Sir
Henry Morgan," cried Hawxherst, angry in turn to
be so browbeaten, though yesterday he would have
taken it mildly enough. "And know by this, sir,"
lifting the paper, "that you are no longer Governor
of this island, and can claim respect from no one."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Mary Rose</i> frigate arrived this morning,
bringing Lord Carlingford as His Majesty's new
Governor, and this order of arrest."</p>

<p>"Arrest? For whom?"</p>

<p>"For one Sir Henry Morgan."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"For what, pray?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, for murder, theft, treason&mdash;the catalogue
fills the paper. You are to be despatched to
England to await the King's pleasure. I am sent
by Lord Carlingford to fetch you to the jail at Port
Royal."</p>

<p>"You seem to find it a pleasant task."</p>

<p>"By heaven, I do, sir!" cried the soldier fiercely.
"I am a gentleman born, of the proudest family in
the Old Dominion, and have been forced to bow
and scrape and endure your insults and commands,
you bloody villain, but now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis no part of a soldier's duty, sir, to insult a
prisoner," interrupted Morgan, not without a certain
dignity. He was striving to gain time to digest
this surprising piece of news and thinking deeply
what was to be done in this entirely unexpected crisis.</p>

<p>"Curse it all, Hawxherst!" Ensign Bradley
burst out, pulling at the sleeve of his superior.
"You go too far, man; this is unseemly."</p>

<p>Hawxherst passed his hand across his brow and
by an effort somewhat regained his self-control.</p>

<p>"Natheless 'tis in this paper writ that you are to
go to England a prisoner on the <i>Mary Rose</i>, to
await the King's pleasure," he added, savagely.</p>

<p>"His Gracious Majesty hath laid his sword upon
my shoulder. I am a knight of his English court,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
one who has served him well upon the seas. His
coffers have I enriched by&mdash;but let that pass. I do
not believe that King Charles, God bless him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! The <i>Mary Rose</i> brings the news that
King Charles II. is dead, and there reigns in his
stead His Gracious Majesty King James."</p>

<p>"God rest the soul of the King!" cried Morgan,
lifting his hat from his head. "He was a merry
and a gallant gentleman. I know not this James.
How if I do not go with you?"</p>

<p>"You have ten minutes in which to decide, sir,"
answered Hawxherst.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then if I don't bring you forth, the men of yonder
troop will come in without further order. Eh,
Bradley?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, Sir Henry," answered the younger
man. "And every avenue of escape is guarded.
Yield you, sir; believe me, there's naught else."</p>

<p>"I have ten minutes then," said the old man
reflectively, "ten minutes! Hum!"</p>

<p>"You may have," answered the captain curtly,
"if you choose to take so long. And I warn you,"
he added, "that you'd best make use of that time
to bid farewell to Lady Morgan or give other order
for the charge of your affairs, for 'twill be a long
time, I take it, before you are back here again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lady Morgan is dead, gentlemen, in the room
above."</p>

<p>At this young Bradley removed his hat, an example
which Hawxherst followed a moment after.
They had always felt sorry for the unfortunate wife
of the buccaneer.</p>

<p>"As for my affairs, they can wait," continued
Morgan slowly. "The game is not played out yet,
and perchance I shall have another opportunity to
arrange them. Meanwhile, fetch glasses, Carib,
from yonder buffet."</p>

<p>He nodded toward a huge sideboard which stood
against the wall immediately in the rear of Ensign
Bradley, and at the same time shot a swift, meaning
glance at the maroon, which was not lost upon
him as he moved rapidly and noiselessly in obedience.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, will you drink with me to our next
merry meeting?" he continued, turning to them.</p>

<p>"We're honest soldiers, honorable gentlemen,
and we'll drink with no murderer, no traitor!"
cried Hawxherst promptly.</p>

<p>"So?" answered Morgan, his eye sparkling with
baleful light, although he remained otherwise entirely
unmoved.</p>

<p>"And let me remind you," continued the soldier,
"that your time is passing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, keep fast the glasses, Carib, the gentlemen
have no fancy for drinking. I suppose, sirs,
that I must fain yield me, but first let me look at
your order ere I surrender myself peaceably to
you," said the deposed Governor, with surprising
meekness.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis my right."</p>

<p>"Well, perchance it may be. There can be no
harm in it, I think; eh, Bradley?" queried the captain,
catching for the moment his subaltern's eye.</p>

<p>Then, as the latter nodded his head, the former
extended the paper to Morgan. At that instant the
old buccaneer shot one desperate glance at the
maroon, who stood back of the shoulder of the officer
with the drawn sword and pistol. As Hawxherst
extended the paper, Morgan, with the quickness of
an albatross, grasped his wrist with his left hand,
jerked him violently forward, and struck him a
vicious blow on the temple with the heavy glass
decanter, which shivered in his hand. Hawxherst
pitched down at the Governor's feet, covered with
blood and rum. So powerful had been Morgan's
blow that the brains of the man had almost been
beaten out. He lay shuddering and quivering on the
floor. Quickly as Morgan struck, however, Carib
had been quicker. As the glass crashed against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
temple of the senior, the maroon had wrenched the
pistol from the junior soldier's hand, and before he
realized what had happened a cold muzzle was
pressed against his forehead.</p>

<p>"Drop that sword!" cried Morgan instantly,
and as the weapon fell upon the floor, he continued,
smiling: "That was well done, Black Dog. Quite
like old times, eh?"</p>

<p>"Shall I fire?" asked Carib, curling his lips over
his teeth in what passed with him for a smile.</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," gasped poor Bradley, "I
didn't want to come. I remonstrated with him a
moment since. For God's sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sirrah! And how much time have I
now, I wonder?" He looked at his watch as he
asked the question. "Three minutes! Three minutes
between you and instant death, Ensign Bradley,
for should one of your men enter the room now
you see what you would have to expect, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, have mercy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless you do exactly what I say you will be
lying there with that carrion," cried Morgan, kicking
the prostrate body savagely with his jewelled shoes.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do? For God's sake
be quick, Your Excellency. Time is almost up. I
hear the men move."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are afraid, sir. There still want two minutes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go to the window yonder," cried the old man
contemptuously&mdash;whatever he was he was not afraid&mdash;"and
speak to them. Do you, Carib, stand behind,
by the window, well concealed. If he hesitate,
if he falter, kill him instantly."</p>

<p>"Pistol or knife?"</p>

<p>"The knife, it makes less noise," cried the buccaneer,
chuckling with devilish glee. "Only one
minute and a half now, eh, Mr. Bradley?"</p>

<p>"They're coming, they're coming!" whispered
Bradley, gasping for breath. "Oh, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We still have a minute," answered Morgan
coolly. "Now, stop them."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"Tell them that you have captured me; that my
wife is dead; that you and Lieutenant Hawxherst
will spend the night here and fetch me down to
Port Royal in the morning; that I have yielded
myself a prisoner. Bid them stay where they are
and drink to your health in bottles of rum, which
shall be sent out to them, and then to go back to
Port Royal and tell the new Governor. And see
that your voice does not tremble, sir!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement outside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"If they get in here," added Morgan quickly,
"you are a dead man."</p>

<p>Bradley, with the negro clutching his arm, ran
to the window. With the point of his own sword
pressed against the back of his neck he repeated the
message which Morgan had given him, which was
received by the little squadron with shouts of approbation.
He turned from the window, pale and
trembling. Moistening his lips he whispered:</p>

<p>"I stopped them just in time."</p>

<p>"Well for you that you did," said Morgan
grimly. "Come hither! Face that wall! Now
stand there! Move but a hair's-breadth, turn your
head the thousandth part of a degree, and I run you
through," he added, baring his sword. "Rum for
the men without, Carib," he added, "and then tell
me when they are gone."</p>

<p>While the two were left alone in the room, Morgan
amused himself by pricking the unfortunate
officer with the point of the weapon, at the same
time enforcing immobility and silence by the most
ferocious threats of a speedy and cruel death. The
men outside drank noisily and presently departed,
and the half-breed came back.</p>

<p>"Bind this fool," Morgan commanded briefly.
"Then bid the slaves keep close in their cabins on
pain of my displeasure&mdash;they know what it is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Then fetch the fastest horse in the stable to the
front door. Get my riding-boots and cloak, and
before you go hand me that little desk yonder. Be
quick about it, too, for time presses, although I
have more of it than these gentlemen would have
allowed me."</p>

<p>As the maroon, after carefully lashing the officer
with a seaman's expertness, rushed out to busy himself
in carrying out these commands, Morgan opened
the desk which he had handed to him and took from
it several rouleaux of gold and a little bag filled
with the rarest of precious stones; then he made a
careful examination of the body on the floor.</p>

<p>"Not quite dead yet," he murmured, "but there
is no use wasting shot or thrust upon him, he won't
survive that blow. As for you, sir," looking at the
paralyzed ensign, lying bound upon the floor, "you
thought you could outwit the old buccaneer, eh?
You shall see. I dealt with men when you were a
babe in arms, and a babe in arms you are still.
Ho! Ho!"</p>

<p>He laughed long and loudly, though there was
neither mirth nor merriment in his sinister tones.
The blood of the poor listener froze in his veins at
the sound of it.</p>

<p>The brief preparations which Morgan had indicated
as necessary for the journey were soon made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 39-40]</a></span>
He was always promptly obeyed by his own people;
the slaves fled his presence when they could as if he
had been a pestilence. At a sign from his taciturn
body-servant at the open door that the horse was
ready, he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Shall I kill this one now?" asked the maroon.</p>

<p>Morgan looked at the young man reflectively.
The tongue of the ensign clave to the roof of his
mouth; the sweat stood out on his forehead; he
could not utter a word from fright. He was bound
and trussed so tightly that he could not make a
move, either. His eyes, however, spoke volumes.</p>

<p>"Well," said Sir Henry deliberately, "it would
be a pity to kill him&mdash;" he paused; "in a hurry,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Dead men tell no tales."</p>

<p>"Eh, well, we can take care of that. Just lay
him near his friend, lock the doors when I am gone
and set the place on fire. The people are all out of
the house. See they remain away. 'Twill make
a hot, glorious blaze. You know the landing opposite
Port Royal?"</p>

<p>The half-breed nodded.</p>

<p>"Meet me there as quick as you can. Lose no
time."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sah," answered the Carib. "And
Lady Morgan, sah?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let her burn with the other two. She is so
saintly she may like the fire, for I am afraid there
will be none where she has gone. Good-by, Master
Bradley. You allowed me ten minutes. I take it
that this house will burn slowly at first, so perhaps
you may count upon&mdash;let us say&mdash;half an hour.
I'm generous, you see. Harry Morgan's way!
'Tis a pity you can't live to take my message to
Lord Carlingford. The next time he sends any one
for me let him send men, not fools and&mdash;cowards."</p>

<p>"You villain! You cursed, murdering villain!"
gasped Bradley at last.</p>

<p>"To our next meeting, Mr. Bradley, and may it
be in a cooler place than you will be in half an
hour!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="center">HOW MASTER BENJAMIN HORNIGOLD, THE ONE-EYED, AGREED
TO GO WITH HIS OLD CAPTAIN</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">

<p>lose under the towering walls of the
old Spanish fort, now for a quarter of a
century dominated by the English flag,
as if seeking protection from its frowning
battlements with
their tiers of old-fashioned
guns, stood the
Blue Anchor tavern. It
had been a famous resort
for the bold spirits of the
evil sort who had made
Port Royal the base of
their operations in many
a desperate sea venture in
piracy in the two decades
that had just passed; but times had changed, even
if men had not changed in them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/004.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The buccaneer had been banished from the Caribbean.
Whereupon, with a circumspect prudence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
he had extended his operations into the South Seas,
where he was farther from civilization, consequently
harder to get at, and, naturally, more difficult to
control. Since the sack of Panama, twenty-five
years before, his fortunes had been rapidly declining.
One of the principal agents in promoting his
downfall had been the most famous rover of them
all. After robbing his companions of most of their
legitimate proportion of the spoils of Panama, Sir
Henry had bought his knighthood at the hands of
the venal Charles, paying for it in treasure, into the
origin of which, with his usual careless insouciance,
his easy-going majesty had not inquired any too
carefully. And the old pirate had settled down, if
not to live cleanly at least to keep within the strict
letter of the law. There was thereafter nothing he
abhorred so thoroughly as buccaneering and the
buccaneer&mdash;ostensibly, that is.</p>

<p>Like many a reformed rake this gentle child of
hell, when the opportunity came to him with the
position of Vice-Governor, endeavored to show the
sincerity of his reformation by his zealous persecution.
He hanged without mercy such of his old
companions in crime as fell into his clutches. They
had already vowed vengeance upon him, these sometime
brethren of the coast, for his betrayal of their
confidence at Panama; they had further resented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
his honor of knighthood, his cloak of respectability,
his assumption of gentility, and now that he hanged
and punished right and left without mercy, their
anger and animosity were raised to the point of
fury, and many of them swore deeply with bitter
oaths that if they ever caught him defenceless they
would make him pay dearly in torture and torment
for these various offences. He knew them well
enough to realize their feelings toward him, and
blind fate affording him the opportunity of the
upper hand he made them rue more bitterly than
ever their wild threats against him.</p>

<p>He had, moreover, so conducted himself in his
official position that everybody, good, bad, and indifferent,
on the island hated him. Why he had
not been assassinated long since was a mystery.
But he was a dangerous man to attack. Absolutely
fearless, prompt, decisive, resourceful, and with the
powers and privileges of the office he held besides,
he had so far escaped all the dangers and difficulties
of his situation. Charles had constantly befriended
him and had refused to give ear either to the reiterated
pleas of the islanders for his removal, or to the
emphatic representations of the Spanish court,
which, in bitter recollection of what he had done&mdash;and
no more cruel or more successful pirate had ever
swept the Caribbean and ravaged the Spanish Main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
&mdash;were persistently urged upon his notice. But
with the accession of James the situation was immediately
altered. The new monarch had at once acceded
to the demand of the Spanish Ambassador,
presented anew at this opportune time, and a new
Governor of Jamaica was despatched over the sea
with orders to arrest Morgan and send him to England.
Hawxherst, who, in common with all the
officers of the insular army, hated the bloodstained
villain whom fortune had placed over them, had
solicited Lord Carlingford to allow him to execute
the order, with what success we have seen.</p>

<p>The news of the long-wished-for downfall of the
tyrant had been spread abroad and formed the one
topic of conversation in Port Royal and the vicinity
that day. Now the work of the day was over and,
as usual, the Blue Anchor tavern was crowded with
men from the frigate and other shipping in the harbor,
mingling with others from the purlieus of the
town. Fumes of rum and spirits pervaded the
tobacco-smoked barroom which served as the main
parlor of the inn. It was yet early in the evening,
but the crowd, inflamed with liquor, was already in
uproarious mood. Over in the corner a young Englishman
was singing in a rich, deep voice a new song
by a famous poet of London town:</p>

<p>
"Let us sing and be merry, dance, joke and rejoice,<br />
With claret and sherry, theorbo and voice!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>The changeable world to our joy is unjust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">All treasure's uncertain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Then down with your dust;</span><br />
In frolics dispose your pounds, shillings and pence,<br />
For we shall be nothing a hundred years hence.<br />
<br />
We'll sport and be free, with Frank, Betty and Dolly,<br />
Have lobsters and oysters to cure melancholy;<br />
Fish dinners will make a man spring like a flea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Dame Venus, love's lady,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Was born of the sea;</span><br />
With her and with Bacchus we'll tickle the sense.<br />
For we shall be past it a hundred years hence."<br />
</p>

<p>It was a popular song, evidently, for the whole
assembly joined in the chorus&mdash;</p>

<p>
"In frolics dispose your pounds, shillings and pence,<br />
For we shall be nothing a hundred years hence."<br />
</p>

<p>They roared it out in the deep bass voices of the
sea, marking the time by hammering in unison upon
the oaken tables with their pewter mugs and flagons.
The sentiment seemed to suit the company, if the
zest with which they sang be any criterion. Care
was taken to insure a sufficient pause, too, after the
chorus between each of the verses, to permit the
drinking, after all the essential part of the evening's
entertainment, to be performed without hindrance.</p>

<p>There was one man, however, from the post of
honor which he occupied at the head of the table
evidently held in high consideration among the
habitu&eacute;s of the inn, who did not join in the singing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
He was a little man, who made up for his shortness
of stature by breadth of shoulder and length of arm.
There was an ugly black patch over his left eye; no
one had ever seen him without that patch since the
day of the assault on the fort at Chagres; an Indian
arrow had pierced his eye on that eventful day.
Men told how he had gone to the surgeon requesting
him to pull it out, and when the young doctor,
who had been but a short time with the buccaneers,
shrank from jerking the barb out in view of the
awful pain which would attend his action, had hesitated,
reluctant, the wounded man had deliberately
torn out the arrow, and with oaths and curses for
the other's cowardice had bound up the wound himself
with strips torn from his shirt and resumed the
fighting. His courage there, and before and after,
although he was an illiterate person and could
neither read nor write, had caused him to be appointed
boatswain of the ship that had carried Morgan's
flag, and he had followed his leader for many
years with a blind devotion that risked all and stuck
at nothing to be of service to him.</p>

<p>It had been many years since Master Benjamin
Hornigold, coming down from bleak New England
because he found his natural bent of mind out of
harmony with the habits and customs of his Puritan
ancestors, had drifted into buccaneering under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
flag of his chief. He was an old man now, but
those who felt the force of his mighty arms were
convinced that age had not withered him to any
appreciable degree.</p>

<p>Aside from Morgan, Hornigold had loved but one
human creature, his younger brother, a man of
somewhat different stamp, who had been graduated
from Harvard College but, impelled by some wild
strain in his blood and by the example of his brother,
had joined the buccaneers.</p>

<p>There were many men of gentle blood who were
well acquainted with the polite learning of the day
among these sea rovers from time to time, and it is
related that on that same Panama excursion when
"from the silent peak in Darien" they beheld for
the first time after their tremendous march the glittering
expanse of the South Seas, with white Panama
in its green trees before them, the old cry of the
famous Ten Thousand, "Thalatta! Thalatta! The
sea! The sea!" had burst from many lips.</p>

<p>All his learning and refinement of manner had not
prevented young Ebenezer Hornigold from being as
bad at heart as his brother, which is saying a great
deal, and because he was younger, more reckless,
less prudent, than he of riper years, he had incautiously
put himself in the power of Morgan and had
been hanged with short shrift. Benjamin, standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
upon the outskirts of the crowd jesting and roaring
around the foot of the gibbet, with a grief and rage
in his heart at his impotency, presently found himself
hating his old captain with a fierceness proportioned
to his devotion in the past. For he had
appealed for mercy personally to Morgan by the
memory of his former services and had been sternly
repulsed and coldly dismissed with a warning that
he should look to his own future conduct lest, following
in the course of his brother, he should find
himself with his neck in the noose.</p>

<p>Morgan, colossal in his conceit and careless in his
courage, thought not to inquire, or, if he gave the
subject any consideration at all, dismissed it from
his mind as of little moment, as to what was the
subsequent state of Hornigold's feelings. Hornigold
could have killed Morgan on numberless occasions,
but a consuming desire for a more adequate
revenge than mere death had taken hold of him, and
he deferred action until he could contrive some
means by which to strike him in a way that he conceived
would glut his obsession of inexpiable hatred.</p>

<p>Hornigold had reformed, outwardly that is, and
was now engaged in the useful and innocent business
of piloting ships into the harbor, also steering
their crews, after the anchors were down, into the
Blue Anchor tavern, in which place his voice and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
will were supreme. He had heard, for Lord Carlingford
had made no secret of his orders, that his
old master was to be arrested and sent back to England.
The news which would have brought joy to
a lesser villain, in that it meant punishment, filled
him with dismay, for such was the peculiarity of his
hatred that he wanted the punishment to come
directly from him&mdash;through his agency, that is.
He desired it to be of such character that it should
be neither speedy nor easy, and he lusted most of
all that Morgan should know in his last hours&mdash;which
Hornigold prayed Satan might be long ones&mdash;to
whom he was indebted for it all.</p>

<p>And, strange as it may seem, there was still a
certain loyalty of a distorted, perverted kind, in the
man's breast. No matter what Morgan had done,
no one else should punish him but himself. He
would even have fought for his sometime chief,
were it necessary, against the King or his law, if
need be. He was therefore very much disturbed
over what he heard. Had it been possible he would
have warned Morgan immediately of his purposed
arrest, but he had been detained on the frigate by
necessary duties from which he could find no means
of escape until too late. He had, however, a high
sense of Sir Henry's courage and address. He
hoped and believed that he would not be taken by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
such men as Hawxherst and Bradley; but if he
were, Hornigold made up his mind to rescue him.</p>

<p>There was a little islet in the Caribbean just below
Hispaniola, in whose wooded interior still
lurked some of the old-time buccaneers, proscribed
men, who, from time to time, did pirating in a small
way on their own account; just enough to keep
their hands in. If the worst came, Hornigold, who
with his little pinnace had kept in touch with them
secretly, could assemble them for the rescue of their
old captain. Then the former Governor, in his
power and in their possession, could be disposed of
at their leisure and pleasure. All these things had
busied the man during the evening, and he sat even
now in the midst of the revelry about him, plunged
in profound thought.</p>

<p>Unobserved himself, he had taken account of
every man who was present. He knew all the
habitu&eacute;s of the port, and enjoyed a wide acquaintance
among the seamen whose vessels frequented
the harbor. He decided there were then in that
room perhaps twenty men upon whom he could depend,
proper inducement being offered, for almost
any sort of service. Among these were five or six
superior spirits whom he knew to be tried and true.
There was young Teach, the singer of the evening,
a drunken, dissolute vagabond, who had been dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>charged
from his last ship for insubordination and
a quarrelsome attack upon one of his officers, for
which he had narrowly escaped hanging as a mutineer.
The man was as bold as a lion, though; he
could be trusted. There, too, was Rock Braziliano,
a Portuguese half-breed, and hobnobbing with him
was Raveneau de Lussan, a Frenchman&mdash;prime seamen
and bold fellows both. Further down the
table, the huge Dutchman, Velsers, was nodding
stupidly over his rum.</p>

<p>These men and a few others were veterans like
Hornigold himself. They were the best of the lot,
but for the most part the assemblage was made up
of the sweepings of the town, men who had the
willingness to do anything no matter how nefarious
it might be, their only deterrent being lack of courage.
Hornigold's single eye swept over them with
a fierce gleam of contempt, yet these were they
with whom he must work in case of necessity.</p>

<p>One or two others in whom he reposed confidence,
men who composed the crew of his own
pinnace, he had sent off early in the evening to
Spanish Town to gather what news they could.
One of them came in and reported that the squadron
of horse which had gone up with the officers to
bring back Morgan had come back without him and
without the officers. The spy's insignificance pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>vented
him from learning why this was, but hope
instantly sprang up in Hornigold's breast upon receipt
of this news. Knowing Morgan as he did, he
was convinced that he had found some means to dispose
of the two officers and send away the cavalry.</p>

<p>He was not unprepared, therefore, when he saw
the tall form of the maroon appearing in the doorway
through the smoke. No one else noticed the
silent Carib's entry, and he stood motionless until
Hornigold's eye fastened upon him. Then by an
imperceptible move of his head he indicated a desire
to speak with him without the room. The one-eyed
nodded slightly in token that he understood, and
the maroon vanished as silently as he had come.
Waiting a few moments, Hornigold rose from his
seat and began threading his way through the boisterous
crowd toward the door. Thrusting aside detaining
hands and answering rude queries with an
old sailor's ready banter, bidding them on no account
to cease the festivities because of his departure,
and in fact ordering a new draught of rum for
all hands, he succeeded in breaking away under
cover of the cheers which greeted this announcement.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark outside and he stopped a moment,
hesitating as to what he should do. He had
no doubt but that the maroon had a message for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
him from his master. But a second had elapsed
when he felt a light touch on his shoulder. His
hand went instantly to the seaman's hanger at his
side and he faced about promptly. A ready man
was Master Hornigold.</p>

<p>"It's I, bo's'n," whispered a familiar voice.</p>

<p>"You, Black Dog? Where's your master?"</p>

<p>"Yonder."</p>

<p>"Let me see him."</p>

<p>A tall, slender figure muffled in a heavy riding-coat
sat in the stern sheets of a small boat in the
deepest shadow of one of the silent and deserted piers.</p>

<p>"Captain Morgan?" whispered Hornigold softly,
as followed by the maroon he descended the landing
stairs leading toward the boat.</p>

<p>"'Tis you, Master Hornigold," answered the
man, with an accent of relief in his voice, thrusting
the pistol back into his belt as he spoke. He, too,
was a ready man with his weapons and one not to
be caught napping in any emergency.</p>

<p>"Me it is, sir," answered the boatswain, "and
ready to serve my old captain."</p>

<p>"You heard the news?"</p>

<p>"I heard it on the frigate this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Why did you not send me warning?"</p>

<p>"I had no chance. I'd 'a' done it, sir, if I could
have fetched away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, all's one. I've laid those two landlubbers
by the heels. Eh, Carib?"</p>

<p>"Where are they, sir?"</p>

<p>"I might make a guess, for I left them bound and
the house blazing."</p>

<p>"'Tis like old times!"</p>

<p>"Ay! I've not forgot the old tricks."</p>

<p>"No, sir. And what's to do now?"</p>

<p>"Why, the old game once more."</p>

<p>"What? You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do. What else is there left for me? Scuttle
me, if I don't take it out of the Dons! It's their
doing. They've had a rest for nigh twenty years.
We'll let it slip out quietly among the islands that
Harry Morgan's afloat once more and there's pickings
to be had on the Spanish Main&mdash;wine and women
and pieces of eight. Art with me?"</p>

<p>"Ay, of course. But we lack a ship."</p>

<p>"There's one yonder, man," cried Morgan, pointing
up the harbor, where the lights of the <i>Mary Rose</i>
twinkled in the blackness.</p>

<p>"To be sure the ship is there, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"We've no force. The old men are gone."</p>

<p>"I am here," answered Morgan, "and you and
Black Dog. And there are a few others left. Teach
is new, but will serve; I heard his bull voice roaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
out from the tavern. And de Lussan and Velsers,
and the rest. I've kept sight of ye. Curse it all, I
let you live when I might have hanged you."</p>

<p>"You did, captain, you did. You didn't hang
everybody&mdash;but you didn't spare, either."</p>

<p>It would have been better for the captain if it had
been lighter and he could have seen the sudden and
sharp set of Master Hornigold's jaws, which, coupled
with the fierceness which flamed into his one eye as
he hissed out that last sentence, might have warned
him that it would be safer to thrust his head into the
lion's mouth than altogether to trust himself to his
whilom follower. But this escaped him in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said quickly. "This is my plan. In
the morning when Hawxherst and Bradley do not
appear, the new Governor will send more men. They
will find the house burned down. No one saw us
come hither. There will be in the ruins the remains
of three bodies."</p>

<p>"Three?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My Lady Morgan's."</p>

<p>"Did you kill her?"</p>

<p>"I didn't have to. They'll think that one of them
is mine. No hue or cry will be raised and no search
made for me. Do you arrange that the crew of the
<i>Mary Rose</i> be given liberty for the evening yonder at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the Blue Anchor. They've not been ashore yet, I
take it?"</p>

<p>"No, but they will go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That's well. Meanwhile gather together the bold
fellows who have stomach for a cruise and are willing
to put their heads through the halter provided there
are pieces of eight on the other side, and then we'll
take the frigate to-morrow night and away for the
Spanish Main. That will give us a start. We'll pick
up what we can along the coast first, then scuttle the
ship, cross the Isthmus, seize another and have the
whole South Seas before us&mdash;Peru, Manila, wherever
we will."</p>

<p>"The King has a long arm."</p>

<p>"Yes, and other kings have had long arms too, I
take it, but they have not caught Harry Morgan, nor
ever shall. Come, man, wilt go with me?"</p>

<p>"Never fear," answered Hornigold promptly.
"I've been itching for a chance to cut somebody's
throat."</p>

<p>He did not say it was Morgan's throat, but the
truth and sincerity in his voice carried conviction to
the listening captain.</p>

<p>"Thou bloody butcher!" he laughed grimly.
"There will be plenty of it anon."</p>

<p>"Where will you lay hid," asked the boatswain,
"until to-morrow night?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have thought of that," said Morgan promptly.
"I think the best place will be the cabin of your
pinnace. I'll just get aboard, Black Dog here and I,
and put to sea. To-morrow night at this hour we'll
come back here again and you will find us here at the
wharf."</p>

<p>"A good plan, Master Morgan," cried Hornigold,
forgetting the title as the scheme unfolded itself to
him. "What's o'clock, I wonder?"</p>

<p>As he spoke the sound of a bell tapped softly came
floating over the quiet water from the <i>Mary Rose</i>.</p>

<p>"Four bells," answered Morgan listening; "at ten
of the clock, then, I shall be here."</p>

<p>"Leave the rest to me, sir," answered Hornigold.</p>

<p>"I shall. That will be your boat yonder?"</p>

<p>"Ay. Just beyond the point."</p>

<p>"Is anybody aboard of her?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Is there rum and water enough for one day?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. In the locker in the cuddy."</p>

<p>"Good! Come, Carib. Until to-morrow night,
then!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," said Hornigold, leaning over the
pier and watching the boat fade into a black blur on
the water as it drew away toward the pinnace.</p>

<p>"He's mine, by heaven, he's mine!" he whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
under his breath as he turned and walked slowly up
to the house.</p>

<p>Yet Master Hornigold meant to keep faith with his
old captain. He was sick and tired of assumed
respectability, of honest piloting of ships to the
harbor, of drinking with worthy merchantmen or the
King's sailors. The itch for the old buccaneering
game was hard upon him. To hear the fire crackle
and roar through a doomed ship, to lord it over shiploads
of terrified men and screaming women, to be
sated with carnage and drunk with liquor, to dress in
satins and velvets and laces, to let the broad pieces of
eight run through his grimy fingers, to throw off
restraint and be a free sailor, a gentleman rover, to
return to the habits of his earlier days and revel in
crime and sin&mdash;it was for all this that his soul lusted
again.</p>

<p>He would betray Morgan, yet a flash of his old
admiration for the man came into his mind as he
licked his lips like a wolf and thought of the days of
rapine. There never was such a leader. He had
indeed been the terror of the seas. Under no one
else would there be such prospects for successful
piracy. Yes, he would do all for him faithfully, up
to the point of revenge. Morgan's plan was simple
and practicable. De Lussan, Teach, Velsers and the
rest would fall in with it gladly. There would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
enough rakehelly, degraded specimens of humanity,
hungry and thirsty, lustful and covetous, in Port
Royal&mdash;which was the wickedest and most flourishing
city on the American hemisphere at the time&mdash;to
accompany them and insure success, provided only
there would be reward in women and liquor and
treasure. He would do it. They would all go
a-cruising once more, and then&mdash;they would see.</p>

<p>He stayed a long time on the wharf, looking out
over the water, arranging the details of the scheme
outlined by Morgan so brilliantly, and it was late
when he returned to the parlor of the Blue Anchor
Inn. Half the company were drunk on the floor
under the tables. The rest were singing, or shouting,
or cursing, in accordance with their several moods.
Above the confusion Hornigold could hear Teach's
giant voice still roaring out his reckless refrain; bitter
commentary on their indifference it was, too&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Though life now is pleasant and sweet to the sense,<br />
We'll be damnably moldy a hundred years hence."<br />
</p>

<p>"Ay," thought the old buccaneer, pausing in the
entrance, for the appositeness of the verses impressed
even his unreflective soul, "it will be all the same in
a hundred years, but we'll have one more good cruise
before we are piped down for the long watch in."</p>

<p>He chuckled softly and hideously to himself at the
fatalistic idea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>By his orders, enforced by the vigorous use of
seamen's colts, the inn servants at once cleared the
room of the vainly protesting revellers. Those whose
appearance indicated a degree of respectability which
promised payment for their accommodation, were
put to bed; the common sort were bundled unceremoniously
out on the strand before the door and left
to sober up as best they might in the soft tropic night.
Teach, Kaveneau, and the Brazilian were detained
for conference with the boatswain. To these
worthies, therefore, Hornigold unfolded Morgan's
plan, which they embraced with alacrity, promising
each to do his share. Velsers was too stupidly drunk
to be told anything, but they knew they could count
upon him without fail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="center">IN WHICH SIR HENRY MORGAN FINDS HIMSELF AT THE HEAD
OF A CREW ONCE MORE</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">

</div>

<p>he next morning, after waiting a reasonable
time for a message from the two
soldiers at Spanish Town, Lord Carlingford,
the new Governor, who had taken
up his residence temporarily at Port Royal, summoned
his attendants, and himself repaired to the
seat of Government to ascertain why no further report
had been received from his officers. Great was
his astonishment when he found that the residence
of the Vice-Governor had been destroyed by fire
during the night. The frightened slaves could tell
nothing. Morgan and Carib had taken care that no
one had marked their departure. Consequently
when the search of the ruins revealed the remains of
three bodies, so badly charred as to be unrecognizable,
it was naturally inferred at first that they were
those of the buccaneer and the two unfortunate
officers. It was known among the people of the
place, however, that Lady Morgan had been seriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
ill, so ill that she could not have been removed, and
there were some who suspected that one of the bodies
was hers and that the arch-fiend himself had by some
means disposed of the officers and escaped. Therefore
a hue and cry was raised for him and a strict
search instituted by order of the Governor, who,
after setting affairs in motion, returned to Port
Royal.</p>

<p>Troops were accordingly ordered out, and even details
of surly seamen, growling at being deprived of
their accustomed shore liberty, were detailed from
the frigate, which happened to be the only war vessel
in commission in the harbor. Hornigold, Raveneau,
and one or two of the others known to be former companions
of the buccaneer, were closely interrogated,
but they stoutly declared they did not know his
whereabouts and had seen nothing of him. Later in
the afternoon it was observed that Hornigold's pinnace
was not in the harbor. Indeed, with cunning
adroitness that master mariner himself called attention
to the fact, cursing the while his old commander
for his alleged theft of the boat, and declaring his
willingness to join in the search for him. It was
known to the authorities that the execution of the
boatswain's brother by Morgan had shattered the old
intimacy which subsisted between them; consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
his protestations were given credence and suspicion
of collusion was diverted from him.</p>

<p>Lord Carlingford finally determined to send the
<i>Mary Rose</i> to sea in an endeavor to overhaul the pinnace,
in the hope that the former Vice-Governor
might be found on her, although the chances of success
were but faint. The frigate, however, was not
provisioned or watered for a cruise, after her long
voyage from England. There had been considerable
scurvy and other sickness on the ship and she was in
no condition to weigh anchor immediately; she would
have to be re-supplied and the sick men in her crew
replaced by drafts from the shore. Besides, in accordance
with the invariable custom, the great majority
of the men had been given shore leave for that
afternoon and evening, and those few who were not
on duty were carousing at the Blue Anchor Inn and
similar taverns and would be utterly unable to work
the ship, should they be called upon to do so, without
being given a chance to sober up. This would take
time, and Lord Carlingford upon the representations
of his sea officers decided to wait until the morrow
before commencing work. One secret of Morgan's
success was the promptness with which he struck.
Nobler and better men could have learned a lesson
from this old buccaneer, notably the Governor.</p>

<p>As he could do so, not only personally but through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
his able lieutenants, Hornigold busied himself during
the day and the preceding night in enlisting as vicious
a gang of depraved ruffians as could be gathered
together in what was perhaps the wickedest city in
the world. It had been decided after conference
between the leaders that there was no place within
the confines of Port Royal itself where so many men
could meet without exciting suspicion. He had accordingly
appointed a rendezvous for the night across
the narrow entrance to the harbor, opposite the fort,
under the trees which overshadowed the strand, some
distance back from high-water mark. Singly or in
groups of two or three, the men had gone across in
boats after sunset, successfully eluding observation,
for the night was moonless and very dark.</p>

<p>There was no room, indeed, for suspicion on the
part of the authorities, save in the bare fact of the
possible escape of Morgan; but it had been twenty
years since that worthy had gone buccaneering, and,
except in the minds of his former companions and
participants, much of the character of his exploits
had passed out of mind. No special watch was kept,
therefore, in fort or town or on the ship. Morgan
was gone certainly, but nothing was feared from a
single proscribed man.</p>

<p>There was rum in plenty under the trees on the
point, but care was taken by Rock Braziliano, Raven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>eau,
and the others, even including Velsers, that no
one should drink enough to lose entire control of his
faculties or to become obstreperous. Just enough
was given to make the timid bold, and the hardy reckless.
They knew the value of, and on occasion could
practise, abstinence, those old buccaneers, and they
were determined to keep their men well in hand. No
fires were lighted, no smoking permitted. Strict
silence was enjoined and enforced. It was perhaps
ten o'clock before all were assembled.</p>

<p>When morning had cleared their brains of the rum
they had taken, there had been ferocious opposition
on the part of the older men. Not that they objected
to buccaneering. They were eager for the chance
once more, but the memory of Morgan's betrayals of
his old comrades rankled deep. There were many
beside Hornigold who had promised themselves the
luxury of vengeance upon their old commander.
There were none, however, who had so dwelt upon it
as the boatswain, nor were there any whose animosity
and determination compared to his fierce hatred. He
was therefore able, at last, to persuade them into a
surly willingness to accept Morgan as their captain in
this new enterprise. Indeed, without him they could
do nothing, for there was no one who possessed the
ability or experience to lead them save he. The best
men of the old stamp were now in the South Seas and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
far away; they had been driven from the Caribbean.
It was not difficult for Hornigold to show them that
it must be Morgan or no one.</p>

<p>Their feelings of animosity were, perforce, sunk
beneath the surface, although they smouldered still
within their breasts. They would go with him, they
said. But let him look to himself, they swore threateningly.
If he betrayed them again, there were men
among them who would kill him as remorselessly as
they would stamp on a centipede. If he behaved
himself and the expedition on which he was to lead
them proved successful, they might forgive him&mdash;all
but old Hornigold. Truth to tell, there was no one
among them who felt himself so wronged or so badly
treated as the one-eyed envenomed sailor.</p>

<p>The bulk of the party, which numbered perhaps
one hundred men, were simply plain, ordinary
thieves, cut-throats, broken-down seamen, land sharks
and rascals. Not much was to be expected of them.
They were not of the stuff of which the old-time buccaneers
had been made, but they were the best to be
obtained at that time in Port Royal. Even they
would not have been so easily assembled had they
realized quite what was expected of them. They
knew, of course, that they were committing themselves
to some nefarious undertaking, but to each
recruit had been vouchsafed only enough informa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>tion
to get him to come to the rendezvous&mdash;no more.
They were a careless, drunken, dissolute lot.</p>

<p>By Hornigold's orders they were told off in five
parties of about twenty each, commanded respectively
by himself, Velsers, Raveneau, the Brazilian, and the
last by Teach, who, though the youngest of the leaders,
had a character for daring wickedness that would
stop at nothing. With much difficulty the boatswain
had succeeded in obtaining five boats, each capable of
carrying one band. Every one brought his own arms,
and in general these men did not lack a sufficiency of
weapons. Those who were deficient, however, were
supplied from a scanty stock which the leaders had
managed to procure.</p>

<p>All was in readiness, when one of the men who had
been stationed on the extreme edge of the beach
toward the channel reported the approach of a small
boat looking like the pinnace.</p>

<p>The wind, fortunately for the enterprise, happened
to be blowing fresh out of the harbor and it was
necessary for the pinnace to beat up toward the entrance.
She showed no lights, but, as she tacked in
close to the shore, between the watcher and the lights
of the town, he observed her. The boat was handled
with consummate skill; she dropped anchor and
hauled down her sails noiselessly just abreast the pier
which had been appointed the rendezvous by the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
men on the night before. As soon as Hornigold
learned of the approach he took a small boat, leaving
Velsers in command of the band on shore, and repaired
with the other leaders to the wharf on the
other side. As the boat approached the wharf it was
hailed in a sharp whisper.</p>

<p>"Who comes?" cried the voice on shore.</p>

<p>"Hornigold!" answered the boatswain in a low
tone, as the boat swept alongside.</p>

<p>"So, 'tis you, is it?" cried Morgan, attended by
the maroon as usual, again putting his pistol back
into his belt. "Seeing so many of you in the skiff, I
feared a trap until you gave the word."</p>

<p>"I've brought along Raveneau, the Brazilian, and
young Teach," said the boatswain.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my hearties, all!" said the Vice-Governor
softly. "We're off to the Spanish Main
with a good ship, plenty of liquor beneath the
hatches, brave hearts to run her. There will be
plenty of pickings meet for any man. Are you with
me?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"We are," answered one and another.</p>

<p>The place where they stood was lonely and deserted
at that time of night, but Hornigold suggested that
they immediately repair to the other side, there to
perfect their further plans. Indeed, they had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
plans as yet. There was not head enough among
them to concoct the details of the scheme, although no
better instruments for an expedition than the chief
and those assembled under him could be gathered
together. They had waited for Morgan.</p>

<p>"You speak well," answered the captain. "Are
all preparations made?"</p>

<p>"All we could make without you, captain," replied
Hornigold as the party re-entered the boat.</p>

<p>"How many men have you gathered?"</p>

<p>"About five score."</p>

<p>"Boats?"</p>

<p>"Five."</p>

<p>"Will they carry all?"</p>

<p>"With a little crowding."</p>

<p>"Who leads each boat?"</p>

<p>"I, one, sir, with your permission; Raveneau here,
another; the Brazilian, the third; young Teach, a
fourth, and Velsers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"With the rest of the men&mdash;the fifth."</p>

<p>"Good! Are they all armed?"</p>

<p>"Every man has a sword and a pistol at least."</p>

<p>"What of the men?"</p>

<p>"A poor lot," answered Teach, recklessly. "A
dastardly crew."</p>

<p>"Will they fight, think ye?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Curse me, they'll have to fight; we'll make
them!" said Hornigold.</p>

<p>"Do they know what's up?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," answered Raveneau, the Frenchman,
a man of good birth and gentle manners, but as
cruel and ruthless a villain as any that ever cut a
throat or scuttled a ship. "Have no fear, captain,"
he continued smoothly. "Once we start them, they
will have to fight."</p>

<p>"Did you ever know me to show fear, de Lussan?"
cried the captain bending forward and staring
at the Frenchman, his eyes glittering in the darkness
like those of a wildcat.</p>

<p>"No, captain."</p>

<p>"No, nor did any other man," answered Morgan,
and from where he sat Hornigold marked the little
dialogue and swore in his heart that this man who
boasted so should beg for his life at his hand, with all
the beseeching pity of the veriest craven, before he
finished with him. But for the present he said nothing.
After a short pause, Morgan resumed:</p>

<p>"Have they suspected my escape?"</p>

<p>"They have," answered the boatswain. "They
found the remains of the three bodies in the burned
house this morning. At first they thought one of
them was yours, but they decided after a while that
one was a woman, and they guessed that you had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
made away with the officers and escaped. I told them
you had stolen my pinnace and got away."</p>

<p>"You did, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And he swore and cursed you roundly, captain,"
interposed the Brazilian chuckling maliciously.
"Aye, sir, he swore if he got hands on you he would
give you up."</p>

<p>Morgan turned this time to Hornigold. He was
by no means sure of his position. He knew the enmity
of these men, and he did not know how far their
cupidity or their desire to take up the old life once
more under such fortunate auspices as would be
afforded under his command would restrain them.</p>

<p>"Master Ben Hornigold, said ye that?" he
queried. "Would ye betray me?"</p>

<p>His hand stole to his waist and his fingers closed
around his pistol grip.</p>

<p>"No fear, captain," answered that worthy composedly,
sustaining the captain's searching gaze. A
braver man never stepped a deck than he. "I did it
to divert their attention. You see, they fancied at
first that we old sea-dogs might have something to do
with your escape, but I undeceived them. They
reckoned that you had been hard on us and that we
might be hard on ye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more of this, gentlemen, the past is gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
We begin again," cried Morgan fiercely. "And
mark me, the man who betrays Harry Morgan will
not live many minutes to boast of it! I'd kill him if
he sat on the steps of a throne. Easy there!" he
called out to the oarsmen, assuming the command as
by right, while the boat's keel grated on the shingle.
"All out now and lead the way. Nay, gentlemen,
you shall all precede me. Carib, here, will bring up
the rear. And it may be well for you to keep your
weapons in your belts."</p>

<p>Much impressed, the little party disembarked and
walked rapidly toward the place of assemblage,
under the trees. Morgan and the maroon came last,
each of them with a bared sword and cocked pistol.</p>

<p>"Lads," said Hornigold, as they approached the
men, "here's your captain, Sir Henry Morgan."</p>

<p>"The Governor!" cried one and another, in surprise
and alarm. The man had been a terror to evildoers
too poor to bribe.</p>

<p>"Nay, men, Governor no more," Morgan answered
promptly. "A free sailor who takes the sea against
the Spanish Dons. We'll go buccaneering as in the
old days. These men here," pointing to the group of
officers, "can tell you what it means. You have
heard tales of the jolly roving life of the brethren-of-the-coast.
We'll do a little picking in the Caribbean,
then over the Isthmus, and then down into the South<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Seas. There's wine and women and treasure to be
had for the taking. The Spaniards are cowards. Let
them hear that Harry Morgan is once more on the
sea under the Jolly Roger and they will tremble
from Darien down to the Straits of Magellan. It
will be fair play and the old shares. Who's with
me?"</p>

<p>"I!" "I!" "I!" broke from the bolder spirits
of the crowd, and the rest, catching the contagion,
finally joined in the acclaim.</p>

<p>"Easy," said the captain, "lest we be heard. Hornigold,
is there liquor?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, sir."</p>

<p>"Let each man have a noble draught, then to the
boats."</p>

<p>"But, captain," spoke up Sawkins, one of the boldest
recruits, who was not in the secret, "be ye goin'
buccaneerin' in boats? Whar's the ship?"</p>

<p>"I have a ship in the harbor," cried Morgan,
"well found and provided."</p>

<p>"Ay, but what ship?"</p>

<p>"Confusion, sir!" shouted Morgan. "Begin ye
by questioning me? Into the boat with your comrades!
Velsers, de Lussan, Rock see that the men
get into the boats as soon as they have their dram.
And hark ye, gentlemen, a word with ye!" calling
them apart while the rest were being served. "Put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the boldest men in the stern sheets with yourselves,
the rest at the oars, and do you have your weapons
ready. The <i>Mary Rose</i> lies just within the bar. You,
Velsers and Rock, gain the fo'c'sl from larboard and
starboard. You, Teach and Raveneau, board at the
different gangways. Hornigold, I'll go in your boat
and we'll attend to the cabin. Let all be done without
noise. No pistols, use the blade. Take no prisoners
and waste no time. If we gain the deck without
difficulty, and I think we can, clap to the hatch
covers and we'll cut cable and get under way at
once."</p>

<p>The men had been embarking in the boats rather
reluctantly as he spoke, but presently all was ready.
Finally Hornigold and then Morgan with the maroon
stepped into the last boat, first making sure there
were no stragglers left behind, and Morgan gave the
command:</p>

<p>"Shove off!"</p>

<p>Sawkins, the bold spirit who had spoken before,
presumed, in spite of the commander's threat, to
open his mouth again as the boats slowly left the
beach, rowing through the passage and up the harbor
against the ebb just beginning; he pulled the stroke
oar in Hornigold's boat.</p>

<p>"Before I go further," he cried, "I want to know
what ship we're goin' aboard of."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay!" came in a subdued roar from the men behind
him, who only needed a leader to back out of
the enterprise, which, as it threatened to involve
fighting, began to seem not quite so much to their
taste. "What ship?"</p>

<p>"The frigate," answered Hornigold shortly.</p>

<p>"What! The <i>Mary Rose</i>! The King's ship!"
cried the men, ceasing to row. In an instant Morgan's
pistol was out. His motion was followed by
Hornigold and the maroon.</p>

<p>"Row, you dogs!" he cried fiercely.</p>

<p>The stroke oarsman hesitated, although the others
tried to pick up the stroke.</p>

<p>"I give you one minute, then I blow out your
brains, pull out the plug in this boat, and we'll all go
to hell together," said Morgan truculently to the recalcitrant
men.</p>

<p>"Row, for your life's sake!" cried the man behind
Sawkins, hitting him in the back with the haft of the
oar.</p>

<p>"It's the King's ship!"</p>

<p>"What do we care for the King?" said Morgan.
"He is the law, and none of us love the law. Two-thirds
of her crew are drunk, t'other third are ashore
or sick. They are unprepared, asleep. There'll be
naught but the anchor watch. One sharp blow, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
we have the frigate&mdash;then away. What fear ye,
lads?"</p>

<p>By such words as these, but more by the threatening
appearance of the weapons pointed from the stern
sheets, Morgan inspirited his men; and by similar
language and threats, the men in the other boats did
the same. After rowing a short distance the flotilla
separated. Those approaching from the farther side
of the ship necessarily made a wide d&eacute;tour, for which
the others waited, so they would all arrive simultaneously.
After a suitable time the order was passed
softly to give way again. In perfect silence, broken
only by the "cheep" of the oars in the locks, the five
boats swept down on the doomed frigate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>he <i>Mary Rose</i> was a ship with a history.
The battle roster of the English navy
had borne many of her name. In each
instance she had been found in the
thickest of the fighting.
The present vessel was
an old ship, having been
built some thirty years
before, but she was still
stanch and of a model
which combined strength
with speed. The most
conspicuous expedition
she had participated in
had been a desperate
defence of a convoy in the Mediterranean against
seven Sallee rovers, in which, after a hard engagement
lasting four hours, the <i>Mary Rose</i> triumphed
decisively without losing a single sail of her convoy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
A rude song was made about the action, and the two
lines of the ballad, summing up the results, were
painted around the wheel:</p>

<p>
"Two we burnt, and two we sank, and two did run away,<br />
And one we carried to Leghorn Roads, to show we'd won the day."<br />
</p>

<p>The commander of the ship on this memorable and
heroic occasion had been knighted on his return to
England, and on the accession of James had been
sent to Jamaica with Lord Carlingford as Vice-Governor,
to take command of the naval station and
supersede Morgan. Admiral Sir John Kempthorne
was an elderly man at this time, but his spirit was the
same that had enabled him to withstand so successfully
the overwhelming onslaught of the Algerine
pirate ships.</p>

<p>The English navy, however, was then in a state of
painful decay. The famous Test Act, which excluded
James from the naval service while he was
Duke of York, because he was a Roman Catholic,
had deprived the navy of its most influential and able
friend. The greedy rapacity with which Charles II.
had devoted the money assigned by the Commons for
the support of the fleet to his own lustful and extravagant
purposes, the favoritism and venality which he
allowed in the administration of the Admiralty, and
the neglect with which he viewed the representations
of Pepys and others as to the condition of his fleets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
had reduced the navy of England, which had won such
immortal glory under Blake, to the very lowest depth
it ever reached. The ships were in bad repair and
commanded by landsmen who shirked going to sea;
they were ill-found, the wages of the seamen not
paid&mdash;in short, they presented pictures of demoralization
as painful as they were unusual.</p>

<p>Kempthorne, having been a tried and a successful
naval commander in his younger days, had striven,
with some success so far as his own ship was concerned,
to stem the prevailing tide of ruin, and the
<i>Mary Rose</i> was perhaps one of the best frigates in
the service, which, however, was not saying a great
deal. He could not, of course, better the character
of the crew which had been provided for him, nor
could he entirely re-supply the ship, or make good her
faulty and deficient equipment, but he did the best
he could. Under ordinary circumstances he could
have given a good account of himself if engaged with
even the perfectly appointed ships of the Dutch Republic,
or of the Grand Monarch himself. Indeed,
in spite of the horrible degeneracy, the prestige of
victory was still, as it has ever been, with England.
King James, a successful, even brilliant naval commander
in his youth, had decided to rehabilitate the
navy with a view to putting it on its old footing, and
with that object in view he had sent one of his best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
admirals across the sea to the important island of
Jamaica, then the headquarters of the West India
Squadron.</p>

<p>Kempthorne had welcomed the duty, and had
determined that so far as the station at Port Royal
was concerned he would make it the model one of the
colonies, of the kingdom itself for that matter, provided
he were sustained by the King as had been
promised. Lord Carlingford, with the zeal of a new
appointee, had promised his co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>The admiral was seated in the cabin of the frigate
that night cogitating upon his plans, when his
thoughts were interrupted by the rattle of oars, indicating
the arrival of a boat. The sound of the
approaching boat came faintly through the open
stern windows of the cabin under the high poop-deck.</p>

<p>The ship was more or less deserted. The sick men
had been put ashore; most of the crew, and the
officers as well, had followed them. They would not
be back until the morrow, when Sir John had orders
to get away in pursuit of Hornigold's pinnace. With
the captain in the cabin, however, was the old master
of the ship, a man who had been promoted to that
rank after the famous fight with the Algerines because
of his gallantry in that action. Kempthorne
was consulting with him about the necessary arrangements
before sailing the next day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>As the admiral heard the noise made by the oars
in the oarlocks he raised his voice, and calling a
sentry, for there was half a platoon of soldiers on
board who had not yet been allowed liberty (the beginnings
of the Royal Marine of England, by the
way), he bade him ascertain if the approaching boat
was that containing the Governor. It was still early
evening, and Lord Carlingford had announced his
intention of sleeping in the ship, for the weather was
intensely warm and he thought it might be cooler in
the harbor than in the crowded low-lying town of
Port Royal.</p>

<p>At the same time the admiral arose, buckled on his
sword, and made ready to go on deck to meet Lord
Carlingford, should it prove to be his expected
visitor. Pausing a moment to say a final word to the
master, he was conscious of something striking the
ship. Before he could formulate the idea that a boat
must have been hit in the bends, there were several
similar shocks. The old master, who happened to be
unarmed, stepped forward.</p>

<p>"That will be a boat, sir," he said quickly, "striking
against the side of the ship. There's another, and
another!"</p>

<p>His voice indicated surprise and some apprehension.
What could it be?</p>

<p>"Let us go on deck at once," said Kempthorne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
stepping forward. As he did so the silence was
broken by a wild, terrified cry. A moment after,
the sentry on the quarter-deck outside the entrance
to the poop cabin fired his piece. The shot was followed
by the sound of a fierce blow, and then a heavy
fall. A sharp, imperious voice cried quickly:</p>

<p>"The ship is ours! Waste no time! Overboard
with him! Clap to the hatch covers!"</p>

<p>The necessity for concealment outside was apparently
at an end. The heavy covers were flung down
upon the hatches and secured. The ship was filled
with a confused babel of many voices and trampling
feet. At the sound of the shot, the admiral and the
master sprang to the door, but before they could pass
the entrance it was flung violently open, and a man
richly dressed after the fashion of Jamaica, followed
by a tall, savage-looking half-breed, a compound of
negro and Indian, clad in a gorgeous livery, each with
pistol and sword, sprang into the room and forced the
two men back. As soon as he could recover himself
Kempthorne whipped out his sword. He found himself
covered, however, as did the master, with a
pistol.</p>

<p>"Throw down your sword!" cried Morgan fiercely,
"and yield yourselves without quarter."</p>

<p>"Who are you that ask?"</p>

<p>"Sir Henry Morgan."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"You bloody villain!" cried Kempthorne. "Dare
you attempt to take the King's ship?"</p>

<p>"That for the King!" answered Morgan, waving
his sword. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Sir John Kempthorne, Admiral and Vice-Governor
of Jamaica."</p>

<p>"You would fain fill my station, would you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I would not descend to the station of a pirate, a
robber, a murderer, a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S'death, silence!" roared Morgan furiously.
"The ship is ours! I've a message for the King.
Wilt carry it?"</p>

<p>"I would not insult my royal master by carrying a
message from such as you."</p>

<p>"You will have it!" shouted Morgan, white with
rage, lunging forward at him.</p>

<p>Their blades crossed in an instant, and at the same
moment the old master, reckless of what happened,
flung himself between the two. There was a roar
from Carib's pistol, and the old man fell. As
Kempthorne relaxed his guard slightly in the confusion
Morgan ran him through. The admiral fell
so suddenly that he jerked the blade, buried in his
breast, out of the buccaneer's hand.</p>

<p>"God&mdash;" he gasped, as he lay upon the body of
the old sailor, "God&mdash;save the&mdash;King."</p>

<p>"Would'st sit in my place, eh?" cried Morgan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
laughing truculently as he turned on his heel and left
the cabin.</p>

<p>Beneath the hatches, the platoon of soldiers and
the men there imprisoned were yelling and making
a tremendous racket. They were helpless, however,
and could do nothing. The men of the boarding
parties were clustered in groups forward and aft and
around the closed passageways into the interior of
the ship, waiting for the next order.</p>

<p>The noise and confusion which had followed the
sentry's bold shot had awakened the attention of the
people of the town. Lights twinkled on the ramparts
of the fort, and the long roll of a drum could be
heard coming faintly up the harbor against the wind.
Lord Carlingford had just entered his boat to board
the ship. There was not a moment to lose.</p>

<p>"Hornigold, go forward with your men to the
forecastle. Velsers, come you hither with yours for
the after guard. Teach, to the fore; Raveneau, to
the main; and Rock, to the mizzenmast. Loose sail.
Lively now. We must get out of this before the
fort's awake," cried Morgan.</p>

<span class="caption">Their blades crossed in an instant.... There was a roar
from Carib&#39;s pistol, and the old man fell.</span>
</div>

<p>Instantly the shrouds were covered with nimble
forms making their way aloft where the wide yard-arms
stretched far over the sea. The men were in
good spirits. The capture of the ship had been so
easy; there had been only the anchor watch and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 86-88]</a></span>sentry on deck to deal with, and they had been murdered
unsuspecting, although the cabin sentry had
killed one of the attacking party and wounded another
before he went down. They jumped with
alacrity, therefore, to obey their captain's commands.
As the ponderous sheets of canvas fell from the
yards, the men lay down from aloft, and sheets and
halyards were manned, the cable that moored the
vessel to the anchor was cut, the ship swung to starboard,
the yards were braced in, and she began to
slip through the water toward the narrow mouth of
the harbor. There were other war vessels in the harbor,
but they were all dismantled and laid up in
ordinary, so the buccaneers had no pursuit to fear.</p>

<p>The guns of the fort commanded the harbor
mouth, and under ordinary circumstances would have
made it impossible for a ship to enter or leave without
permission. The mouth was narrow and dangerous,
but the best pilot in the West Indies stood forward
leaning over the knightheads, conning the ship.
Raveneau and Velsers, than whom no better seamen
ever held a spoke, by Morgan's orders were stationed
at the wheel to steer the frigate. Rock and Teach
distributed the best of the men among the guns of
the spar-deck battery on the port side. As was usual,
the guns were already charged. There were no
loggerheads available, no matches with which to fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
them, but Morgan instructed those who seemed to
have some skill in gunnery, whom he placed in temporary
charge of the cannon, how to fire them by
snapping their pistols at the touch-holes, which were
primed from a powder horn that had been brought by
the pirates.</p>

<p>The land breeze was fresh and strong, and the
<i>Mary Rose</i> vindicated her claim to be considered a
fast sailer. She fairly ripped down the harbor,
threading her way through the channel under Hornigold's
nice pilotage until she came near to the narrow
entrance. By Morgan's orders each man remained
motionless at the place where he had been stationed,
and the ship, so far as human noise was concerned,
was as still as death. Even the soldiers below, finding
no attention paid to their cries, had subsided into
comparative quiet. The silence was broken only by
the creaking of cordage, the dashing of water against
the bows, and the groaning of the timbers. Ever and
anon Hornigold's deep voice, crying "Larboard" or
"Starboard" as the case might be, rolled along the
deck to the watchful men gripping the wheel. Suddenly
the old buccaneer cried out sharply:</p>

<p>"There's a boat right ahead, sir."</p>

<p>"Run her down!" answered Morgan instantly.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! Starboard! Starboard again! Let her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
go off another half-point. Steady! Very well dyce.
Now! Meet her! Meet her!"</p>

<p>The ship swept around slightly and rushed directly
at the boat. It was the boat of the Governor. Instantly
wild cries arose from the men on the thwarts.
They were stopped by a stern voice.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, the <i>Mary Rose</i>!"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, the frigate! What are you doing?
Where is Admiral Kempthorne?"</p>

<p>At that instant the soldiers beneath the hatches
suddenly resumed their commotion, thus apprising
the men in the boat that something was sadly wrong.</p>

<p>"Larboard your helm!" cried a voice from the
boat, "or you'll be on us. Who's in command?
What are you about?"</p>

<p>"Sir Harry Morgan!" shouted a voice out of the
darkness. "And we mean to run you down."</p>

<p>"Back water, for God's sake! Stern, all!" cried
Lord Carlingford to the paralyzed rowers; but before
they could move the looming bow of the frigate was
upon them. Carlingford had risen in his boat before
the collision, and with dauntless courage he shook his
bared sword in the darkness toward the ship.</p>

<p>"The King will triumph!" he cried.</p>

<p>"You can go to hell!" shouted Morgan, "with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Hawxherst and Bradley and Kempthorne and all who
oppose me."</p>

<p>A terrible, smashing crash cut short his words,
and, amid the ripping, tearing sound of the parting
timbers of the overridden boat, and shouts, cries, and
appeals for mercy, the <i>Mary Rose</i> swept on. One
or two beneath her forefoot leaped frantically at
the bobstays, but they were driven from their holds
by savage pike thrusts from Hornigold's men.</p>

<p>A wild yell of elation broke from the pirates.
They were completely possessed by their success now,
but Morgan stopped the noise in an instant.</p>

<p>"Silence!" roared the captain. "We are not
yet free. Back to your stations! Stand by the larboard
battery!"</p>

<p>At that time the entrance to the harbor was very
narrow, and the channel swept close under the Port
Royal shore. Everybody in the town knew that something
had happened on the frigate. The garrison of
the fort was out and the guns were loaded and bore
fair upon the channel. Softly, for they were within
earshot distance of the fort, Morgan passed the word
to train the guns of the battery on the parapet of
the fort. He also told off all the men with small arms
to line the side, with instructions for them to fire at
the port-holes of the fort as they passed, and he
charged every one, under pain of death, to keep all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
fast until he gave the word. Hornigold bent all his
mind to getting the ship safely out of the harbor.
Two or three reliable men were stationed in the gangway,
whose sole business it was to repeat his commands
without fail during the confusion, no matter
what happened. They were right in the entrance
now, and coming opposite the fort. The men below
were still keeping up a great noise, but a hail which
came across the water from the rampart was entirely
audible, the distance not being more than half pistol
shot.</p>

<p>"Hello, the <i>Mary Rose</i>! Hello, the frigate!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay! What is it?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going? Where's Lord Carlingford?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The rapidly moving ship
was fairly abreast the fort now. In thirty seconds
she would be beyond it.</p>

<p>"We have killed the Governor and Kempthorne,
and this is the ship of Sir Henry Morgan, bound for
the Spanish Main on a buccaneering cruise. Fire!"</p>

<p>A perfect hail of shot at point blank range belched
forth from the twenty-four guns of the larboard battery
of the onrushing ship. In the surprise and confusion
caused by this murderous discharge at short
range, the frigate slipped by, and although every gun
in the fort, whether it bore or not, was finally dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>charged
by the infuriated soldiery, no serious damage
was done to the ship. Here and there a man fell.
The starboard main topsail sheet was cut, a few ropes
parted, but that was all. Pouring a perfect hail of
musketry and pistol fire upon the surprised garrison,
which did execution, the frigate slipped through the
channel. Before the cannon could be reloaded they
were out of range. There before them lay the open
sea, bounded to the southward by the rich and unprotected
cities of the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>"We're out of the harbor, sir," cried Hornigold,
coming aft to where Morgan stood triumphant on the
poop.</p>

<p>"That's well!" said the commander. "Secure
the guns and muster the crew. We'll divide into
watches and bear away to the southward."</p>

<p>"Long live Sir Henry Morgan, King of the Buccaneers!"
cried a voice out of the darkness, and amid
a tremendous roar of cheers the vessel swept away,
leaving the lights of Port Royal twinkling faintly in
the distance far behind them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>en days after her departure from Port
Royal the <i>Mary Rose</i> was tumbling
southward before a gentle breeze
through the blue and languid seas.
Much had happened in the interval. In the first
place, Morgan had organized and drilled the ship's
crew relentlessly. With the aid of the five principal
adventurers, whom he had constituted his lieutenants,
he had brought the motley crowd which he had
shipped into a state of comparative efficiency and of
entire subjection to his iron will. Years of quasi-respectability,
of financial position, of autocratic
power as Vice-Governor had modified the ideas of
the old buccaneer, and the co-operative principle
which had been the mainspring of action as well as
tie which produced unity among the brethren-of-the-coast
had ceased to be regarded, so far as he was concerned.
He took care, however, to be upon fairly
amicable terms with the officers in command and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
veterans, though he treated the rest of the riff-raff
like the dogs they were. They murmured and raged
but did not revolt, although it was quite possible that
if he pushed them too far, and they found a leader,
they might make trouble.</p>

<p>In accordance with Hornigold's advice, after deliberation
between Morgan and the leaders, the <i>Mary
Rose</i> had first run up to La Vaca Island, south of
Hispaniola, and the number of original marauders
had been increased by fifty volunteers, all those,
indeed, who could be reached, from the small pirates
who made that delectable spot their rendezvous. In
addition to those, the crew had also been re&euml;nforced
largely from those of the unpaid and discontented
seamen and soldiers of the frigate who had happened
to be under hatches the night of the capture. Presented
with the choice of instant death or adherence
to the band, most of them had accepted the latter alternative,
although, to their great credit be it said, not
until one or two of the loyal veterans, who had hotly
refused to have anything to do with their ruffianly
captors, had been forced to walk the plank as an
example to the rest should they prove recalcitrant.
Partly through terror, partly through discontent,
partly on account of promises of the great reward
awaiting them, speciously urged by Morgan himself,
for he could talk as well as he could fight, and, most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of all, because even at that date it was considered a
meritorious act to attack a Spaniard or a Papist
under any circumstances or conditions, especially by
persons as ignorant as the class in question, some
seventy cast in their lot with the rest.</p>

<p>Among the two hundred and twenty members of
the heterogeneous crew so constituted, were to be
found natives of almost every race under the sun,
even including one or two Spanish renegados, and it
would be safe to say that the lowest and meanest
representatives of the several races were assembled
on that very ship. The officers and men who had
been recruited from Isla La Vaca, as well as the
older original members of the crew of the <i>Mary
Rose</i>, together with a select few of the remainder,
were men of approved courage. The officers, indeed,
bore reputations for hardihood and daring not to be
surpassed. Most of the rest, however, were arrant
cowards. As a body the band could not compare,
except in leadership, with the former bands of buccaneers
who had made themselves and their names a
terror to Latin civilization in the New World.</p>

<p>Morgan himself, however, almost made up for all
deficiencies. Age had not quenched his ardor,
diminished his courage, or deprived him of that magnetic
quality which had made him an unquestioned
leader of men. His eye was as keen, his hand as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
steady, his soul as reckless, and his skill as high as
when he had led the greatest buccaneer fleet that had
ever assembled, on the famous Panama expedition.
Everybody on the ship hated him except young
Teach and the faithful Black Dog; the old buccaneers
because he had betrayed them, the soldiers
and sailors of the crew because he had captured their
ship and forced them to become his allies, the mean
and lowly body of rascals because he kept them ruthlessly
under hand. But they all feared him as much
as they hated him and they admired him as much as
they feared him.</p>

<p>So far as he was concerned discipline was absolute.
He still seemed to fancy himself the Vice-Governor
and the representative of that King against whom he
had taken up arms. He demanded to be treated
accordingly. No admiral of the fleet was ever served
more promptly and respectfully than he. Even his
nearest associates were treated with a certain
haughtiness, which they bitterly resented and which
they would have called in question had the situation
been other than it was. Truth to tell, influenced by
Hornigold, they had embarked upon a mad enterprise,
and they needed Morgan to bring it to a successful
conclusion. Without him the slender coherence
which already existed would fail, and anarchy
would be the state upon the ship. There would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
nothing left to them but to scatter if they could make
an unheeded landing at some convenient place, or be
captured, if they could not, with a certainty of being
hung forthwith. So long as they remained together,
it was certain that Morgan would lead them on some
successful enterprise and they might get some reward
for their risks and crimes. In his safety lay their
safety.</p>

<p>The buccaneer was entirely aware of this, and
therefore counted freely upon the backing of the
veterans among the officers and crew. He would
take care of the rest.</p>

<p>The ship, however, was a floating colony of suspicion,
treachery, and hatred. Morgan himself never
appeared without being loaded with weapons, not for
bravado but for use should occasion rise, and his back
was always protected by the silent and gigantic
maroon, whom the sailors, catching the title from
those who had known him of old, referred to with
malignant hatred as "Black Dog." That was a
name, indeed, which the taciturn half-breed rather
rejoiced in than resented. Morgan had been able to
awaken love in no hearts except those of young
Teach, whose feeling was admiration rather than
affection, and this half-breed maroon. Whether it
was from his black African mother or from his fierce
red Carib father he inherited the quality of devotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
was not apparent. Devoted he had been and devoted
he remained.</p>

<p>Close association in the narrow confines of the ship
with the man who had, as he believed, wronged him,
had but intensified Hornigold's hatred. The One-Eyed
found it difficult to dissemble, and took refuge
in a reticence which was foreign to his original frank
and open character. Morgan half suspected the state
of affairs in his old boatswain's moiled and evil soul,
and he watched him on account of it more closely
than the others, but with no great disquiet in his
heart. Truth to tell, the old pirate was never so
happy as in the midst of dangers, imminent and
threatening, which would have broken the spirit of
a less resolute man. There was one among the
officers he was sure of and upon whom he could
depend in an emergency, and that was young Teach.
He had flattered him by unusual marks of kindness,
and alone among the officers this fellow did not seem
to cherish the rancor and suspicion of the others.
He was too young to have experienced a betrayal as
had the rest; this was his first venture in actual
piracy and he found it marvelously pleasant.</p>

<p>The officers, too, were all suspicious of one another.
As each one nursed his own private designs he suspected
the others of doing likewise&mdash;and with reason.
But there was as yet little outward friction among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
them. Raveneau, for instance, was most scrupulously
polite to the captain and his associates. Velsers
was too stupid in his cups&mdash;and he was generally
in them&mdash;to do more than growl, and the Brazilian
had all the capacities of his race for subtle concealment.</p>

<p>Although the necessary orders for working the
ship were obeyed and Morgan personally imposed
implicit obedience and respect for his commands, no
duties other than those required were performed by
the men. During the day when not at work or at
drill, they drank, smoked, gambled, and fought at
pleasure, although, as the captain mercilessly exercised
them during long hours at the great guns and
with small arms, they did not have any too much
leisure for play. During the night they kept watch
and watch, of course, but in it all they took no care
of the ship, and filth and dirt abounded. If they had
anticipated a long cruise things would necessarily
have been different, but as they had gone far to the
southward now, and might make a landfall at any
moment there was no necessity for bothering about
mere cleanliness, which, as it is supposed to be next
to godliness, was naturally far removed from this
band of cut-throats. Morgan had not communicated
his ultimate purposes to his men as yet, but as he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the only navigator on the ship he was, perforce,
allowed to have his own way.</p>

<p>Breakfast had been served&mdash;a meagre breakfast it
was, too, for all hands were on short allowance of
everything but spirits, on account of the unprovided
state of the ship. Fortunately for their contentment,
there was plenty of rum on board. The men were
congregated forward on the forecastle or in the waist,
wrangling and arguing as usual. The officers gathered
on the quarter-deck, and Morgan paced the high
raised poop alone, overlooking them, when the lookout
suddenly reported three sail in sight. The half-drunken
sailor who had been sent aloft at daybreak
had kept negligent watch, for almost as soon as he
had made his report the ships were observed from
the deck of the frigate.</p>

<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> had the wind on her quarter, her
best point of sailing, and she was covered with canvas
from her trucks to her decks, from her spritsail
yard to her huge mizzen crossjack, a lateen sail. The
wind was light, but she was making rapid progress
toward the approaching strangers, who, with their
larboard tacks aboard, were beating up toward the
English.</p>

<p>Attended by the maroon, Morgan, pistol in hand,
went forward to the forecastle, kicking his way clear
through the sullen, black-browed mass of sailors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
He ran a short distance up the weather fore-shrouds
and took a long look at the strangers. They all flew
the yellow flag of Spain. One was a huge galleon,
the other two smaller ships, though larger in each
instance than the <i>Mary Rose</i>, and all heavily armed.</p>

<p>One of the plate ships from Porto Bello was due
in this latitude about this time, and Morgan instantly
surmised that the galleon was she, and that the two
others were Spanish frigates to give her safe convoy
across the ocean. Spain was at peace with all the
world at that time, and the two frigates would have
been ample to ward off the attack of any of the small
piratical craft which had succeeded the buccaneer
ships of the Caribbean. The Spaniards had no idea
that such a vulture as Morgan was afloat; therefore,
although they had sighted the <i>Mary Rose</i> long before
she had seen them because they kept better watch,
they came on fearlessly and without hesitation. It
was evident to the experienced officers among them
that the vessel was an English frigate, and as England
was a country with which there was profound
peace at the time they apprehended nothing.</p>

<p>The position of the approaching ships with reference
to one another was somewhat peculiar. The
first and smallest frigate was perhaps half a mile
ahead of her consorts, who were sailing side by side,
a cable's length apart. Morgan at once determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
to attack them. He knew that he possessed the
handiest ship, and he believed that he had discovered
a way to master the other three. The two frigates
were the most dangerous antagonists. If he could
dispose of them the galleon would be at his mercy.
He did not hesitate to encounter such odds, and even
in the minds of the craven part of the crew one
English ship was thought to be good for any three
Spaniards that ever floated.</p>

<p>The interest of the crew had been excited by the
approaching strangers, which were rapidly drawing
nearer. They ceased their arguments and strife,
therefore, and crowded forward, looking alternately
from the foreign ships to their own leader, lightly
poised on the sheer-poles scanning the enemy. There
were plenty of men of sufficient experience among
them to pronounce them Spanish ships immediately,
and they therefore anticipated that work lay before
them that morning. Presently Morgan sprang down
upon the forecastle and faced his men.</p>

<p>"Lads," he said, "those are Spanish ships."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," came from one another as he
paused a moment to let the significance of his announcement
sink in.</p>

<p>"And," he continued, raising his voice so that it
was audible throughout the ship, "the great one will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
be one of the plate ships homeward bound&mdash;but she'll
never get there&mdash;from Porto Bello!"</p>

<p>A perfect yell of delight drowned his further
remarks. The men shrieked and shouted and hurrahed
at the joyous announcement, as if all they
had to do was to go aboard and take the ships. When
the hullabaloo had subsided, Morgan continued:</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you take it so bravely, for while
there is treasure enough under her hatches to make
us all rich, yet we'll not get it without a fight, for
yonder are two heavily armed frigates. We'll have
to dispose of them before we get at the galleon. But,
hearts of oak, I never saw the buccaneer who wasn't
worth three or a dozen of the Dons, and with a stout
ship like this one under my feet and a band of brave
hearts like you I wouldn't hesitate to tackle the whole
Spanish navy. It means a little fighting, but think
of the prize!" he cried, playing skilfully upon the
cupidity of his men. "Some of us will lose the number
of our messes, perhaps, before nightfall; but,"
he continued, making a most singular and effective
appeal, "there will be more to divide for each man
that is left alive. Are you with me?"</p>

<p>"To the death!" cried young Teach, who had
come forward and mingled with the crowd, lifting a
naked cutlass as he spoke. His cry was taken up and
repeated, first by one and then another until the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
whole body was yelling frantically to be given a
chance to fight the Spanish ships.</p>

<p>"That's well," said Morgan grimly. "Master
Teach, here, will command forward on the fo'c'sl.
Raveneau and Velsers shall attend to the batteries in
the waist. I appoint you, Hornigold, to look after
the movements of the ship. See that the best hands
are at the wheel and have sail trimmers ready. My
Portuguese friend, you may look to the after guns.
Now to your stations. Cast loose and provide! Man
the larboard battery! See every thing is ready, but
hold your fire and keep silence under pain of death!
Yon frigate over there, we'll strike first. She'll be
unprepared and unsuspecting. One good blow ought
to dispose of her."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the men hurried to their stations.
There was no lack of skill on the frigate, and now
was seen the value of Morgan's constant drilling.
The cannon of the ship were cast loose and loaded,
loggerheads and matches lighted, small arms distributed
and primed, pikes were served out, cutlasses
loosened in their sheaths, and such as had armor, still
worn in greater or less degree even in that day,
donned it, and the ship was full of busy preparation.</p>

<p>"We've no flag flying, sir," said Hornigold as
the men settled down to their stations, grim and
ready.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay," said Morgan, "show the English flag.
We'll make as much trouble for his gracious majesty,
King James, as possible."</p>

<p>In a short time the glorious colors of England,
which had never waved over so despicable a crew before,
rippled out in the freshening breeze. As they
were rapidly approaching the Spanish ship now, Morgan
descended from the poop-deck to make a personal
inspection of his frigate before beginning
action. He found everything to his taste, and
passed along the lines of silent men congregated
around the guns with words of stern appreciation.</p>

<p>The crews of the guns had been constituted with
great care. The gun captains in each instance were
tried and proved seamen, men as fearless as they
were capable. The weaker and the more wretched
portion of the band had been so placed that opportunity
for showing cowardice would be greatly circumscribed,
and the stern command of the captain
that the officers and petty officers should instantly
shoot any man who flinched from duty was not without
effect. He did not hesitate to remind the men,
either, that they fought with halters around their
necks. As even the craven becomes dangerous when
pushed to the wall, he felt they would give a good
account of themselves.</p>

<p>"Hornigold," said Morgan, as he stepped up on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the quarter-deck again, "I want the frigate to pass
as close to windward of that Spanish ship as you can
bring her without touching. Let her not suspect our
desire, but whirl into her as we get abreast. Don't
fall foul of her as you value your life!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," answered that veteran, squinting
forward along the jib-boom with his one eye as if
measuring the distance, "I'll bring her close enough
for you to leap aboard and yet never touch a rope
yarn on her."</p>

<p>He spoke with the consciousness and pride of his
skill.</p>

<p>"Now, lads," cried Morgan, "have everything
ready, and when I give the word pour it in on yonder
ship. I want to settle her with one broadside. It'll
be touch and go, for we've got to dispose of her in
an instant. Stand by for the word! Now, lie down,
all, behind the bulwarks and rails. Let us make no
show of force as we come up. We must not arouse
suspicion."</p>

<p>The two ships, the <i>Mary Rose</i> going free, the
Spanish frigate close hauled on the port tack, were
now within hailing distance. As they approached
each other the buccaneer could see that the other
ship was crowded with men. Among her people the
flash of sunlight upon iron helms denoted that she
carried a company of soldiers. The Spaniards were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
entirely unsuspecting. The men had not gone to
their quarters, the guns were still secured; in short,
save for the military trappings of the soldiers on
board and the tompioned muzzles of her cannon, she
was in appearance as peaceful a vessel as sailed the
seas.</p>

<p>The two ships were near enough now to make conversation
possible, and the <i>Mary Rose</i> was hailed by
a tall, richly dressed officer in glistening breastplate
and polished steel cap, standing on the forecastle of
the other ship.</p>

<p>"What ship is that?" he cried in broken English.</p>

<p>"This is the frigate <i>Mary Rose</i>." The usual
answer to such a hail would have been: "This is His
Britannic Majesty's frigate <i>Mary Rose</i>," but the
Spaniards suspected nothing as Morgan continued,
"carrying Sir Henry Morgan, sometime Vice-Governor
of the Island of Jamaica."</p>

<p>"I have the honor to wish the Vice-Governor a
very good morning," answered the Spaniard, courteously
waving his hand in salutation.</p>

<p>"Now, Hornigold, now!" said Morgan in a fierce
whisper.</p>

<p>The old boatswain sprang himself to the wheel.
With his powerful hands he revolved it quickly until
it was hard up. The frigate answered it instantly.
She swung away toward the Spaniard to leeward of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
her with a suddenness that surprised even her steersman.</p>

<p>"And I salute the Vice-Governor," continued the
Spanish captain, just as the English ship swept down
upon him; and then he cried in sudden alarm and
excitement:</p>

<p>"Have a care, se&ntilde;or! What mean you? You
will be aboard of us! Hard up with the helm!"</p>

<p>As soon as the <i>Mary Rose</i> had begun to fall off,
ay, even before her motion had been perceptible,
Hornigold had reversed the helm.</p>

<p>"Flow the head sheets there," he cried, shoving
the wheel over spoke by spoke with all the force of
his arms. "Flatten in aft a little, here! Steady!
Very well dyce. We're right abreast now, Captain,"
he said.</p>

<p>Almost as quickly as she had fallen off the nimble
frigate, beautifully handled, came to the wind again.
She was now almost in touch with the other ship.
Hornigold's seamanship and skill had been magnificent.
He had done all that was asked of him and
all that he had promised.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," answered Morgan in triumphant commendation.
"Handsomely done. I could leap
aboard!"</p>

<p>The Spanish ship was filled with confusion. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
captain, with his face black with rage, stood on the
forecastle shaking his fist.</p>

<p>"This is outrageous, sir!" he shouted. "You
have nearly run us down! What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want to return your salute," answered Morgan
suavely. "Up, lads!" he cried. As the men sprang
to their feet, he roared out fiercely: "Stand by!
Fire! Pour it into them!"</p>

<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> was almost in contact with the
Spanish ship, when a perfect tornado of fire burst
from her side. Every gun in her broadside, and she
was a forty-eight gun frigate, was discharged point-blank
at the astonished enemy. Not waiting to reload
the guns, the crew seized the small arms ready
charged to hand, and as they slowly swept by poured
a withering fire upon the Spaniard's crowded decks.
Out of the flame and smoke the <i>Mary Rose</i> burst
upon the astounded eyes of the officers and men of
the two remaining ships. The first frigate was a
wreck on the water. Some of the pirate guns had
been depressed, great holes had been opened by the
shot, the masts had been carried away, and the devoted
ship was sinking, her decks covered with dead
and dying.</p>

<p>"We wish you the compliments of the morning,
se&ntilde;or," roared Morgan, facing aft toward the bat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>tered
and ruined frigate. "How like you our
salute?"</p>

<p>But the captain of the Spanish vessel lay dead
upon his bloody deck, and if any answered the jeering
taunt it was drowned by the laughter and cheering
of the English crew. They had eliminated the
first ship from the game. They had diminished their
enemies by a third, and full of confidence they swept
down upon the other two.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">IN WHICH IS RELATED THE STRANGE EXPEDIENT OF THE
CAPTAIN AND HOW THEY TOOK THE GREAT GALLEON</p>

<p>lthough they could not comprehend
the reason for the vicious attack upon
their consort by a ship of a supposedly
friendly power, it was evident to the
Spaniards in the two remaining
ships that the
English frigate was approaching
them with the
most sinister and malevolent
purpose. One
glance at the sinking remains
of their ruined
and battered consort established
that fact in the
most obtuse mind. Consequently
the exultant men on the <i>Mary Rose</i> could
hear the shrill notes of the trumpeters on the two
other ships calling their men to arms.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/008.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>With a confidence born of success, however, Mor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>gan
resolutely bore down upon the enemy. Even the
dastards in his crew had been excited by the ease and
success of the first treacherous blow and plucked up
courage, believing that their captain's invincible
skill, address, and seamanship would carry them
safely through the next encounter.</p>

<p>The Spanish had little warning after all, for the
breeze was rapidly freshening, and in what seemed
an incredibly short time the English frigate was
close at hand. Though they worked with a desperate
energy they had not entirely completed those preparations
required by the shock of battle. As usual,
Morgan was determined to lose no time. If he could
have thrown his vessel upon them out of the fire and
smoke of the first broadside he would have gained
the victory with scarcely less difficulty than he had
seized the first advantage, but that was not to be, and
it was with considerable anxiety that he surveyed the
crowded decks of the two remaining ships.</p>

<p>He had no fear of the armament of either one,
but if those Spanish soldiers ever got a footing upon
his own deck it was probable they could not be dislodged
without a tremendous sacrifice of life; and as
he gazed over his motley crew he even questioned
their ability to contend successfully with such a mass
of veterans. He had hoped that the remaining
frigate would detach herself from the galleon, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
which event the superior handiness and mobility of
his own ship, to say nothing of his probable advantage
in the way in which his batteries would be
fought, would enable him to dispose of her without
too much difficulty. Then he could with ease place
the huge and unwieldy galleon at his mercy. But
the two Spanish ships stuck close together, too close
indeed, Morgan thought, for their own safety. They
were both on the wind with their larboard tacks
aboard, the frigate slightly ahead of and to windward
of the galleon, on the side, that is, whence the <i>Mary
Rose</i> was approaching. So far as he could divine it,
the Spanish plan, if they had formulated any in their
hurry, appeared to be for the frigate to engage the
<i>Mary Rose</i>, and while she had the latter ship under
her battery, the galleon would tack across the
English vessel's bows, or stern as might be, rake her,
get her between the two ships, run her aboard, and
thus effect her ruin. The plan was simple, practicable,
and promised easy success, provided the Englishman
did what was expected of him.</p>

<p>Morgan was not to be caught napping that way.
As he rushed down upon them there came into his
head one of the most daring ideas that has ever
flashed across a seaman's brain. Hastily summoning
Braziliano he bade him take a dozen of his men,
descend to the after magazine, procure two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
barrels of powder from the gunner, and stow them in
the cabin under the poop-deck. He charged him to
do it as quietly as possible and take only men for the
purpose upon whom he could depend. While this
was being done young Teach was also summoned
from the forecastle, his place being taken by old
Velsers, whose division in the battery was placed
under the command of Raveneau. There was a
whispered colloquy between the chieftain and his
young subordinate, after which the latter nodded his
head, ran below, and concealed himself in one of the
staterooms under the quarter-deck. In a little space
the Portuguese reappeared with his men and announced
that they had completed their task; whereupon
they were directed to return to their stations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crew had been recharging the battery
and reloading the small arms. Morgan addressed
to them a few words of hearty approval
of their previous actions and predicted an easy victory
over the two ships. The Spanish captain naturally
supposed&mdash;and indeed the courses upon which
the three ships were sailing if persisted in would have
brought about the result&mdash;that the <i>Mary Rose</i> would
pass along his larboard side, and the two vessels
would engage in the formal manner of the period,
yard-arm to yard-arm, until the galleon could get
into action and so settle it in the purposed way. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
intended, of course, if it could be brought about, to
throw the masses of soldiers he was transporting
home upon the English decks, and carry the frigate
by boarding.</p>

<p>Again Morgan put Hornigold in charge of the
man&oelig;uvering of the ship, and again that old worthy
chose to handle the spokes himself. There was a
brief conversation between them, and then the English
captain ran forward on the forecastle. The ships
were very near now. In a moment or two they would
pass each other in parallel courses, though in opposite
direction, and their broadsides would bear; but when
the <i>Mary Rose</i> was about a cable's length from the
Spanish frigate something happened.</p>

<p>The astonished Don heard a sharp command ring
out from the approaching English ship, after which
she made a wide sweep and came driving straight at
him at a furious speed. The English captain intended
to run him down! Here was to be no passage
along his broadside. The other was upon him! The
cutwater of the onrushing ship loomed up before
him tremendously. Instantly all was confusion on
the Spanish ship! The steersman lost his head, and
without orders put his helm up sharply; some one cut
the sheet of the after-sail on the huge lateen yard,
and the frigate went whirling around on her heel like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
a top, in a violent and fatal, as well as vain, effort to
get out of the road.</p>

<p>It was a most foolish man&oelig;uvre, for close at hand
on the lee side of her the galleon came lumbering
along. Her captain, too, had seen the peril, and had
elected to meet it by tacking under his consort's
stern. But he was too near, and the other ship fell
off and was swept to leeward too rapidly. His own
ship, cumbersome and unwieldy, as they always were,
was slow in answering the helm. The frigate and
galleon came together with a terrific crash. The
shock carried away the foretopmast of the frigate,
which fell across the head yards of the galleon. The
two ships were instantly locked together. They
swung drifting and helpless in the tossing waters.</p>

<p>Morgan had counted upon this very catastrophe.
A twist of the helm, a touch of the braces, and the
prow of the <i>Mary Rose</i> swung to windward. As her
batteries bore she hurled their messengers of death
into the crowded masses on the Spanish ships. Although
dismayed by the collision, the gunners on the
frigate made a spirited reply with a discharge which
at such close range did much execution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for her, the <i>Mary Rose</i> had rushed
so close to the two entangled ships that it was impossible
for her to escape hitting them. The English
captain would have given anything if he could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
gone free of the mass, for he could have passed under
the stern of the two helpless ships, raked them, and
probably would have had them at his mercy; but his
dash at them had been an earnest one, and in order
to carry out his plan successfully he had been forced
to throw his ship right upon them. Therefore,
though the helm was shifted and the braces hauled
in an effort to get clear, and though the ship under
Morgan's conning and Hornigold's steering was
handled as few ships have ever been handled, and
though it was one of the speediest and most weatherly
of vessels, they could not entirely swing her clear.
The stern of the frigate crashed against the stern of
the nearest Spanish ship drifting frantically to leeward.</p>

<p>The Spanish captain, mortified and humiliated beyond
expression by the mishap, instantly realized
that this contact presented them with a possibility of
retrieving themselves. Before the ships could be
separated, grappling irons were thrown, and in a
second the three were locked in a close embrace.
Morgan had anticipated this situation also, although
he had hoped to avoid it, and had prepared for it.
As the two ships became fast the high poop and rail
of the Spaniard were black with iron-capped men.
They swarmed over on the lower poop and quarter-deck
of the <i>Mary Rose</i> in a dense mass. Fortunately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the small arms on both sides had been discharged a
moment before and there had been no time to reload.
The remainder of the engagement to all intents and
purposes would be fought with the cold steel.</p>

<p>Morgan had gained an advantage in throwing the
two ships into collision, but he appeared to have lost
it again because he had been unable to clear the
wrecks himself. The advantage was now with the
Spaniards, whose force outnumbered his own two or
three to one. Surprising as it was to the old buccaneers
and the bolder spirits among his crew, whose
blood was up sufficiently to enable them to long for
the onset, Morgan had run to the waist of the ship
when he saw the inevitable collision and had called
all hands from the poop and quarter. The <i>Mary
Rose</i> was provided with an elevated quarter-deck and
above that a high poop. Massing his men in the
gangways just forward of the mainmast and on the
forecastle itself, with the hardiest spirits in the front
line and Morgan himself in advance of all sword in
hand, the two parties contemplated each other for a
little space before joining in the onset.</p>

<p>The poop and quarter-deck were crowded so thick
with Spanish soldiers and sailors that room could
scarcely be found for the increasing procession, for,
anxious to be in at the death, the men of the galleon
clinging to the frigate ran across and joined their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
comrades. Here were trained and veteran soldiers in
overwhelming numbers, with the advantage of position
in that they fought from above down, to oppose
which Morgan had his motley crew behind him.</p>

<p>"Yield, you dastardly villain!" shouted the captain
of the Spanish frigate, who was in the fore of
his men.</p>

<p>"Shall I have good quarter?" cried Morgan.</p>

<p>A low growl ran through the ranks of the buccaneers
at this question. Yet the rapscallions among
the crew back of him instantly took up the cry.</p>

<p>"Quarter! Quarter! We surrender! We
strike! For heaven's sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" roared Morgan&mdash;an order which was
enforced by the officers and veterans by fierce blows
with pistol butts, hilts of swords, and even naked
fists. "I would hear the answer of the Spanish captain."</p>

<p>"We give no quarter to pirates and murderers,"
the other shouted.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," said Morgan triumphantly,
and as he spoke he drew from his pocket a
silver whistle like a boatswain's call. He blew it
shrilly before the wondering men.</p>

<p>At that instant Teach, followed by the few men
who had remained below in the powder division,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
came running up to Morgan from the hatchway between
the two forces.</p>

<p>"Is't done?" cried the captain.</p>

<p>"Ay, sir. In another&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forward, gentlemen!" shouted the Spanish captain,
dropping from the quarter-deck to the main-deck.
"God and St. Jago! Have at them!"</p>

<p>Before he had taken two steps the terrific roar of
a deafening explosion came to the startled buccaneers
out of the blast of flame and smoke, in the midst of
which could be heard shrieks and groans of the most
terrible anguish. Teach had connected the powder
with the fuse, and when he had heard the sound of
Morgan's whistle, the agreed signal, he had ignited
it and blown up the stern of the frigate.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were hurled in every direction. So
powerful was the concussion that the front ranks of
the buccaneers were also thrown down by it. Morgan
happened to fall by the side of the Spanish captain,
and the latter, though badly wounded, with
determined and heroic valor raised himself on his
arm and strove to kill the buccaneer. But the faithful
Carib, who had reserved one charged pistol by his
master's command for such an emergency, shot him
dead.</p>

<p>Morgan struggled to his feet and looked at the
scene. Some of his men did not rise with the others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
for they had been killed by the falling splinters and
bits of iron. The whole stern of the <i>Mary Rose</i> was
gone. There wasn't a Spaniard left before them.
A few figures shrieking vainly for help, clutching at
floating pieces of timber, might be seen struggling in
the sea. The Spanish frigate had a great hole in the
port side of her after-works. She was on fire. The
three ships were rocking as if in a hurricane.</p>

<p>Panic filled the minds of the greater part of the
buccaneers at this tremendous catastrophe. Had
Morgan to save himself ruined his own ship? They
were appalled by the terrific expedient of their captain.
Wild cries and imprecations burst forth.</p>

<p>"The ship is sinking!"</p>

<p>"We are lost!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" shouted Morgan, again and again.
"The ship is sinking, but our ship is there. Let
those who love life follow me."</p>

<p>He sprang at the burning rail of the Spanish
frigate. Black Dog was at his heels, Ben Hornigold
followed hard upon, Teach was on the other side.
From the waist Raveneau and the Brazilian strove to
inspire the men. Old Velsers from the forecastle
drove them forward as quickly as he could. Presently
they recovered their courage in some measure,
for the fighting force of the enemy had disappeared.
They had lost a ship, but there were two other ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
before them. They swarmed over the rail with
cheers and cries. There was little or no resistance.
The men of the frigate were stunned into helplessness
by the explosion, although the captain of the
galleon rallied a few men and fought until they were
all cut down, and the two ships were taken by storm.</p>

<p>They had scarcely gained the deck of the galleon
before the remains of the <i>Mary Rose</i> sank beneath
the sea, the wounded upon the decks vainly crying
for succor.</p>

<p>By this time the weather side of the remaining
Spanish ship was a mass of flame and there was imminent
danger that the fire would be communicated
to the galleon. Giving his men time for nothing,
Morgan set to work furiously to extricate himself.
Axes and hatchets were plied and all the skill and
seamanship of the conquerors brought into play.
Finally they succeeded in getting clear and working
away from the burning frigate. Morgan at once put
the galleon before the wind, and when he had drawn
away a short distance, hove to the ship to take account
of the damage before determining his future
course.</p>

<p>Far back on the ocean and low in the water drifted
the sinking remains of the first Spanish frigate.
Near at hand was the hulk of the second ship, now a
blazing furnace. The first was filled with living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
men, many of them desperately wounded. No attention
was paid to them by the buccaneers. They cried
for mercy unheeded. Anyway their suspense would
soon be over. Indeed, the first ship sank and the
second blew up with a fearful explosion a short time
after they got away. A brief inspection showed that
the galleon had suffered little or no damage that
could not be repaired easily at sea. Taking account
of his men, Morgan found that about twenty were
missing. Taking no care for them nor for the two
ships he had fought so splendidly, pirate though he
was, he clapped sail on the galleon and bore away to
the southward.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>he <i>Almirante Recalde</i>, for such was the
name of the galleon, was easily and
speedily repaired by the skilled seamen
of the <i>Mary Rose</i> under such leadership
and direction as the experience
of Morgan and
the officers afforded. By
the beginning of the first
dog-watch even a critical
inspection would scarcely
have shown that she had
been in action. With the
wise forethought of a
seaman, Morgan had subordinated
every other
duty to the task of making the vessel fit for any
danger of the sea, and he had deferred any careful
examination of her cargo until everything had been
put shipshape again; although by his hurried ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>tioning
of the surviving officers he had learned that
the <i>Almirante Recalde</i> was indeed loaded with treasure
of Peru, which had been received by her <i>via</i> the
Isthmus of Panama for transportation to Spain. On
board her were several priests returning to Spain
headed by one Fra Antonio de Las Casas, together
with a band of nuns under the direction of an aged
abbess, Sister Maria Christina.</p>

<p>In the indiscriminate fury of the assault one or
two of the priests had been killed, but so soon as the
ship had been fully taken possession of the lives of
the surviving clerics and the lives of the good sisters
had been spared by Morgan's express command.
These unfortunate women had been forced into the
great cabin, where they were guarded by men in
whom confidence could be placed. The priests were
allowed to minister to their dying compatriots so long
as they kept out of the way of the sailors. No feeling
of pity or compassion induced Morgan to withhold
the women from his crew. He was a man of prudent
foresight and he preserved them for a purpose, a
purpose in which the priests were included.</p>

<p>In the hold of the ship nearly one hundred and
fifty wretched prisoners were discovered. They were
the crew of the buccaneer ship <i>Daring</i>, which had
been commanded by a famous adventurer named
Ringrose, who had been captured by a Spanish squad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ron
after a desperate defense off the port of Callao,
Peru. They were being transported to Spain, where
they had expected summary punishment for their
iniquities. No attention whatever had been paid to
their protests that they were Englishmen, and indeed
the statement was hardly true for at least half of
them belonged to other nations. In the long passage
from Callao to the Isthmus and thence through the
Caribbean they had been kept rigorously under
hatches. Close confinement for many days and enforced
subsistence upon a scanty and inadequate diet
had caused many to die and impaired the health of
the survivors. When the hatch covers were opened,
the chains unshackled and the miserable wretches
brought on deck, their condition moved even some of
the buccaneers to pity. The galleon was generously
provided for her long cruise across the ocean, and the
released prisoners, by Morgan's orders, were liberally
treated. No work was required of them; they were
allowed to wander about the decks at pleasure, refreshed
by the open air, the first good meal they had
enjoyed in several months, and by a generous allowance
of spirits. As soon as they learned the object
of the cruise, without exception they indicated their
desire to place themselves under the command of
Morgan. Ringrose, their captain, had been killed,
and they were without a leader, which was fortunate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in that it avoided the complications of divided command.
Fortunate, that is, for Ringrose, for Morgan
would have brooked no rival on such an expedition.</p>

<p>As soon as it could be done, a more careful inspection
and calculation satisfied the buccaneer of the immense
value of his prize. The lading of the galleon,
consisting principally of silver bullion, was probably
worth not far from a million Spanish dollars&mdash;pieces
of eight! This divided among the one hundred and
eighty survivors of the original crew meant affluence
for even the meanest cabin boy. It was wealth such
as they had not even dreamed of. It was a prize the
value of which had scarcely ever been paralleled.</p>

<p>They were assembled forward of the quarter-deck
when the announcement was made. When they
understood the news the men became drunk with joy.
It would seem as if they had been suddenly stricken
mad. Some of them stared in paralyzed silence,
others broke into frantic cheers and yells, some reeled
and shuddered like drunken men. The one person
who preserved his imperturbable calmness was Morgan
himself. The gratitude of these men toward
him was overwhelming. Even those who had good
cause to hate him forgot for the time being their
animosity&mdash;all except Hornigold, whose hatred was
beyond all price. Under his leadership they had
achieved such a triumph as had scarcely ever befallen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
them in the palmiest days of their career, and with
little or no loss they had been put in possession of a
prodigious treasure. They crowded about him presently
with enthusiastic cheers of affection and extravagant
vows of loving service. All, that is, except
Hornigold, whose sense of injury, whose thirst for
vengeance, was so deep that all the treasure of Potosi
itself would not have abated one jot or one tittle
of it.</p>

<p>The general joy, however, was not shared by the
rescued buccaneers. Although they had but a few
hours before despaired of life in the loathsome depths
of the vile hold, and they had been properly grateful
for the sudden and unexpected release which had
given them their liberty and saved them from the
gibbet, yet it was not in any human man, especially
a buccaneer, to view with equanimity the distribution&mdash;or
the proposed distribution&mdash;of so vast a treasure
and feel that he could not share in it. The fresh air
and the food and drink had already done much for
those hardy ruffians. They were beginning to regain,
if not all their strength, at least some of their courage
and assurance. They congregated in little groups
here and there among Morgan's original men and
stared with lowering brows and flushed faces at the
frantic revel in which they could not participate.
Not even the cask of rum which Morgan ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
broached to celebrate the capture, and of which all
hands partook with indiscriminate voracity, could
bring joy to their hearts. After matters had quieted
down somewhat&mdash;and during this time the galleon
had been mainly left to navigate herself&mdash;Morgan
deemed it a suitable occasion to announce his ultimate
designs to the men.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, shipmates, and bold hearts all," he
cried, waving his hand for silence, "we have captured
the richest prize probably that floats on the
ocean. There are pieces of eight and silver bullion
enough beneath the hatches, as I have told you, to
make us rich for life, to say nothing of the gold,
jewels, spices, and whatnot, besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by another yell of appreciation.</p>

<p>"But, men," he continued, "I hardly know what
to do with it."</p>

<p>"Give it to us," roared a voice, which was greeted
with uproarious laughter, "we'll make away with it."</p>

<p>Morgan marked down with his eye the man who
had spoken and went on.</p>

<p>"The ports of His Majesty, the King of England,
will be closed to us so soon as our capture of the <i>Mary
Rose</i> is noted. England is at peace with the world.
There is not a French or Spanish port that would give
us a haven. If we appeared anywhere in European<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
waters with this galleon we would be taken and
hanged. Now, what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"Run the ship ashore on the New England coast,"
cried the man who had spoken before. "Divide the
treasure. Burn the ship and scatter. Let every man
look to his own share and his own neck."</p>

<p>"A plan, a plan!"</p>

<p>"Ay, that'll be the way of it!"</p>

<p>"Sawkins is right!"</p>

<p>"To the New England shore! Ben Hornigold will
pilot the ship!" burst in confused clamor from the
crew to whom the plan appealed.</p>

<p>"By heaven, no!" shouted Morgan. "That's well
enough for you, not for me. I'm a marked man.
You can disappear. I should be taken, and Hornigold
and Raveneau and the rest. It won't do. We
must stay by the ship."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"Keep to the original plan. We'll sail this ship
down to the Spanish Main and capture a town, divide
our treasure, make our way overland to the Pacific,
where we'll find another ship, and then away to the
South Seas! Great as is our booty, there is still more
to be had there for the taking. We'll be free to go
where we please with the whole South American coast
at hand. There are islands, tropic islands, there,
where it's always summer. They are ours for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
choosing. We can establish ourselves there. We'll
found a community, with every man a law for himself.
We'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the recital of this Utopian dream was rudely
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Nay, Master," cried Sawkins, who had done
most of the talking from among the crew, "we go
no farther."</p>

<p>He was confident that he had the backing of the
men, and in that confidence grew bold with reckless
temerity. Flushed by the victory of the morning,
the rum he had imbibed, intoxicated by the thought
of the treasure which was to be shared, the man went
on impudently:</p>

<p>"No, Sir Harry Morgan, we've decided to follow
our latest plan. We'll work this ship up to the New
England coast and wreck her there. There are plenty
of spots where she can be cast away safely and none
to know it. We'll obey you there and no further.
We've got enough treasure under hatches to satisfy
any reasonable man. We're not afeared o' the King
if you are."</p>

<p>"You fool!" thundered Morgan. "You will be
hanged as soon as your part in the adventure is
known."</p>

<p>"And who is to make it known, pray? As you
said, we are poor ignorant men. It's nothing to us if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
you are marked, and you, and you," he continued,
stepping forward and pointing successively at Morgan
and the little band of officers who surrounded
him. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,
we'd have you understand, and we're content with
what we've got. We don't take no stock in them
islands of yours. We can get all the women we want,
and of our own kind without crossing the Isthmus.
We don't want no further cruisin'. There's no need
for us to land on the Spanish Main. We've made up
our minds to 'bout ship and bear away to the northward.
Am I right, mates?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, right you are!" roared the men surging
aft.</p>

<p>"You mutinous hound!" yelled Morgan, leaning
forward in a perfect fury of rage, and his passion was
something appalling to look upon.</p>

<p>Hornigold clutched at the helm, which had been
deserted by the seamen detailed to it during the
course of the hot debate. The old man cast one long,
anxious glance to windward where a black squall was
apparently brewing. But he said nothing. The argument
was between Morgan and his crew, there was
no need for him to interfere. Teach, Raveneau,
Velsers, and the officers drew their pistols and bared
their swords, but most of the crew were also armed,
and if it came to a trial of strength the cabin gang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
was so overwhelmingly outnumbered that it would
have been futile to inaugurate a contest.</p>

<p>Morgan, however, was frantic with rage. To be
braved by a member of his crew, to have his plans
balked by any man, and to be openly insulted in this
manner! He did not hesitate a second. He rushed
at Master Bartholomew Sawkins, and, brave man as
that sailor was, he fairly quailed before the terrific
incarnation of passionate fury his captain presented.
The rest of the crew gave back before the furious
onset of Sir Henry.</p>

<p>"You dog!" he screamed, and before the other
realized his intention he struck him a fearful blow
in the face with his naked fist. Always a man of unusual
strength, his rage had bestowed upon him a
Herculean force. He seized the dazed man by the
throat and waist belt ere he fell to the deck from the
force of the blow, and lifting him up literally pitched
him overboard. Before the crew had recovered from
their astonishment and terror at this bold action, the
buccaneer officers closed behind their captain, each
covering the front ranks of the men with a pistol. At
the same instant the other men, Ringrose's crew,
came shoving through the crowd, snatching such
arms as they could in the passage, although most of
them had to be satisfied with belaying pins.</p>

<p>"We're with you, Captain Morgan," cried one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
their number. "We've had no treasure, and it seems
we're not to have a share in this either. We've been
in the South Seas," continued the speaker, a man
named L'Ollonois, noted for his cruelty, rapacity, and
success, "and the captain speaks truly. There are
all that can delight brave men and a race of cowards
to defend them. What's this treasure? It is great,
but there are other things we want&mdash;wine and
women!"</p>

<p>The man who had been thrown overboard had
shrieked for help as he fell. The splash he had made
as he struck the water had been followed by another.
A Spanish priest standing by the rail had seized a
grating and thrown it to the man. Morgan took in
the situation in a glance.</p>

<p>"Who threw that grating?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I, se&ntilde;or," composedly answered the priest, who
understood English.</p>

<p>Morgan instantly snatched a pistol from de Lussan's
hand and shot the man dead.</p>

<p>"I allow no one," he shouted, "to interfere between
me and the discipline of my men! You speak
well, L'Ollonois. And for you, hounds!" he roared,
clubbing the smoking pistol and stepping toward the
huddled, frightened men, "get back to your duties
unless you wish instant death! Scuttle me, if I don't
blow up the galleon unless you immediately obey!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 138-140]</a></span>Bear a hand there! If you hesitate&mdash;Fire on
them!" he cried to his officers, but the men in the
front did not linger. They broke away from his presence
so vehemently that they fell over one another in
the gangways.</p>

<span class="caption">Morgan instantly snatched a pistol from de Lussan&#39;s hand and
shot the man dead.</span>
</div>

<p>"Don't fire!" they cried in terror. "We'll go
back to duty."</p>

<p>Morgan was completely master of the situation.</p>

<p>"I am to be obeyed," he cried, "implicitly, without
question, without hesitation!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!"</p>

<p>"We will, we will!"</p>

<p>"That's well. Heave that carrion overboard,"
kicking the body of the priest. "Now we'll go back
and pick up Sawkins," he continued. "Ready about,
station for stays!"</p>

<p>"Look you, Captain Morgan," cried Hornigold,
pointing to leeward. "The squall! 'Twill be soon
on us. We'd best reduce sail and run for it."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Morgan, "I'll allow not even a storm
to interfere with my plans. Flow the head sheets
there! Hard down with the helm! Aft, here some
of you, and man the quarter boat. I said I'd pick
him up, and picked up he shall be, in spite of hell!"</p>

<p>The ship, like all Spanish ships, was unhandy and
a poor sailor. Morgan, however, got all out of her
that mortal man could get. With nice seamanship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
he threw her up into the wind, hove her to, and
dropped a boat overboard. Teach had volunteered
for the perilous command of her and the best men on
the ship were at the oars. Sawkins had managed to
catch the grating and was clinging feebly when the
boat swept down upon him. They dragged him aboard
and then turned to the ship. The sinister squall was
rushing down upon them from the black horizon with
terrific velocity. The men bent their backs and
strained at the oars as never before. It did not seem
possible that they could beat the wind. The men on
the ship beseeched Morgan to fill away and abandon
their comrades.</p>

<p>"No!" he cried. "I sent them there and I'll wait
for them if I sink the ship!"</p>

<p>Urged by young Teach to exertion superhuman,
the boat actually shot under the quarter of the galleon
before the squall broke. The tackles were
hooked on and she was run up to the davits with all
her crew aboard.</p>

<p>"Up with the helm!" cried Morgan the instant
the boat was alongside. "Swing the mainyard and
get the canvas off her. Aloft, topmen, settle away
the halliards! Clew down! Lively, now!"</p>

<p>And as the ship slowly paid off and gathered away
the white squall broke upon them. The sea was
a-smother with mist and rain. The wind whipped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
through the shrouds and rigging, but everything
held. Taking a great bone in her teeth the old <i>Almirante
Recalde</i> heeled far over to leeward and
ripped through the water to the southward at such a
pace as she had never made before. On the quarter-deck
a drenched, shivering, and sobbing figure knelt
at Morgan's feet and kissed his hand.</p>

<p>"Wilt obey me in the future?" cried the captain
to the repentant man.</p>

<p>"'Fore God, I will, sir," answered Sawkins.</p>

<p>"That's well," said the old buccaneer. "Take
him forward, men, and let him have all the rum he
wants to take off the chill of his wetting."</p>

<p>"You stood by me that time, Sir Henry," cried
young Teach, who had been told of Morgan's refusal
to fill away, "and, by heaven, I'll stand by you in
your need!"</p>

<p>"Good. I'll remember that," answered Morgan,
glad to have made at least one friend among all he
commanded.</p>

<p>"What's our course now, captain?" asked Hornigold
as soon as the incident was over.</p>

<p>"Sou'west by west-half-west," answered Morgan,
who had taken an observation that noon, glancing in
the binnacle as he spoke.</p>

<p>"And that will fetch us where?" asked the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
man, who was charged with the duty of the practical
sailing of the ship.</p>

<p>"To La Guayra and Venezuela."</p>

<p>"Oho!" said the old boatswain, "St. Jago de
Leon, Caracas, t'other side of the mountains will be
our prize?"</p>

<p>"Ay," answered Morgan. "'Tis a rich place and
has been unpillaged for a hundred years."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and walked away. He
vouchsafed no further information and there was no
way for Master Ben Hornigold to learn that the object
that drew Morgan to La Guayra and St. Jago
was not plunder but the Pearl of Caracas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="center">HOW THEY STROVE TO CLUB-HAUL THE GALLEON AND
FAILED TO SAVE HER ON THE COAST OF CARACAS</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">

</div>

<p>wo days later they made a landfall off
the terrific coast of Caracas, where the
tree-clad mountains soar into the clouds
abruptly from the level of the sea,
where the surf beats without intermission even in
the most peaceful weather upon the narrow strip of
white sand which separates the blue waters of the
Caribbean from the massive cliffs that tower above
them.</p>

<p>In the intervening time the South Sea buccaneers
had picked up wonderfully. These men, allured by the
hope of further plunder under a captain who had been
so signally successful in the past and in the present,
constituted a most formidable auxiliary to Morgan's
original crew. Indeed, with the exception of the old
hands they were the best of the lot. L'Ollonois had
been admitted among the officers on a suitable footing,
and there was little or no friction among the
crews. They were getting hammered into shape,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
too, under Morgan's hard drilling, and it was a
vastly more dangerous body of men than the
drunken gang who had sailed away from Jamaica.
Though not the equal of the former buccaneering
bands who had performed in their nefarious careers
unheard of prodigies of valor and courage, they were
still not to be despised. Had it been known on the
Spanish Main that such a body was afloat there
would have been a thrill of terror throughout the
South American continent, for there were many who
could remember with the vividness of eye-witnesses
and participants the career of crime and horror which
the old buccaneers had inaugurated.</p>

<p>Like a politic captain, Morgan had done his best
to get the men whom he had subdued by his intrepid
courage and consummate address into good humor.
Rum and spirits were served liberally, work was
light, in fact none except the necessary seaman's
duties were required of the men, although an hour or
two every day was employed in hard drill with
swords, small arms, and great guns. In martial
exercises the veterans were perfect, and they assiduously
endeavored to impart their knowledge to the
rest.</p>

<p>It was Morgan's plan to run boldly into La Guayra
under the Spanish flag. No one could possibly take
the <i>Almirante Recalde</i> for anything but a Spanish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
ship. There was no reason for suspecting the presence
of an enemy, for Spain had none in these seas.
If there were other ships in the roadstead, for the
harbor of La Guayra was really nothing more than
an open road, the buccaneer could easily dispose of
them in their unprepared condition. Indeed, Morgan
rather hoped that there might be others, for,
after he captured them, he would have a greater
force of guns to train upon the forts of the town,
which he expected to take without much difficulty,
and then be governed in his man&oelig;uvres toward Caracas
by circumstances as they arose.</p>

<p>Two days after the capture of the galleon, then,
with the wind fresh from the northeast, on a gray,
threatening, stormy morning, she was running to the
westward along the shore. A few hours at their
present speed would bring them opposite La Guayra,
whose location at the foot of the mighty La Silla of
Caracas was even then discernible. Morgan could see
that there were two or three other vessels opposite the
town straining at their anchors in the heavy sea.
Every preparation for action had been made in good
time and the guns had been loaded. The sea lashings
had been cast off, although the gun-tackles were carefully
secured, for the wind was blowing fresher and
the sea running heavier every hour.</p>

<p>The men were armed to the teeth. There hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>pened
to be a goodly supply of arms on the Spanish
ship in addition to those the buccaneers had brought
with them, which were all distributed. Many a steel
cap destined for some proud Spanish hidalgo's head
now covered the cranium of some rude ruffian whom
the former would have despised as beneath his feet.</p>

<p>Everything was propitious for their enterprise but
the weather. The veterans who were familiar with
local conditions in the Caribbean studied the northeastern
skies with gloomy dissatisfaction. The wind
was blowing dead inshore, and as the struck bells denoted
the passing hours, with each half-hourly period
it grew appreciably stronger. If it continued to
blow, or if, as it was almost certain, the strength of
the wind increased, it would be impossible without
jeopardizing the ship to come to anchor in the exposed
roadstead. They would have to run for it. Nay,
more, they would have to beat out to sea against it,
for the coast-line beyond La Guayra turned rapidly
to the northward.</p>

<p>Morgan was a bold and skilful mariner, and he
held his course parallel to the land much longer than
was prudent. He was loath, indeed, to abandon even
temporarily a design upon which he had determined,
and as he had rapidly run down his southing in this
brief cruise his determination had been quickened by
the thought of his growing nearness to the Pearl of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Caracas, until for the moment love&mdash;or what he
called love&mdash;had almost made him forget the treasure
in the ship beneath his feet. For the Pearl of Caracas
was a woman.</p>

<p>Mercedes de Lara, daughter of the Viceroy of
Venezuela, on her way home from Spain where she
had been at school, to join her father, the Count Alvaro
de Lara in the Vice-regal Palace at St. Jago de
Leon, sometimes called the City of Caracas, in the
fair valley on the farther side of those towering tree-clad
mountains&mdash;the Cordilleras of the shore&mdash;had
touched at Jamaica. There she had been received
with due honor, as became the daughter of so prominent
a personage, by the Vice-Governor and his
wretched wife. Morgan's heart had been inflamed
by the dark, passionate beauty of the Spanish maiden.
It was only by a severe restraint enjoined upon himself
by his position that he had refrained from abusing
the hospitality he extended, by seizing her in the
old buccaneer fashion. The impression she had made
upon him had been lasting, and when he found himself
alone, an outlaw, all his dreams of the future
centered about his woman.</p>

<p>He would carry out the plans which he had outlined
to his men, but the Pearl of Caracas, for so
Donna Mercedes was called, must accompany him to
the South Seas to be the Island Queen of that Buc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>caneer
Empire of which he was to be the founder.
That Donna Mercedes might object to this proposition;
that she might love another man, might even
be married by this time, counted for nothing in Morgan's
plans. He had taken what he wanted by dint
of his iron will and the strength of his right arm in
the past and he should continue the process in the
future. If the hand of man could not turn him, certainly
the appeal of woman would avail nothing.</p>

<p>Consequently he was most reluctant that morning,
for his passion had increased with each o'er-run
league of sea, to bear away from La Guayra, which
was the port of entry for Caracas; but even his ardent
spirit was at last convinced of the necessity. It
was blowing a gale now and they were so near the
shore, although some distance to the eastward of the
town, that they could see the surf breaking with
tremendous force upon the strip of sand. The
officers and older men had observed the course of the
ship with growing concern, but no one had ventured
to remonstrate with Morgan until old Ben Hornigold
as a privileged character finally summoned his courage
and approached him.</p>

<p>"Mark yon shore, Captain Morgan," he said, and
when he made up his mind he spoke boldly. "The
wind freshens. We're frightfully near. Should it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
come on to blow we could not save the ship. You
know how unseamanly these Spanish hulks are."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Hornigold," answered Morgan,
yet frowning heavily. "Curse this wind! We must
claw off, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Ay, and at once," cried Hornigold. "See, the
wind shifts already! It blows straight from the
north now."</p>

<p>"Hands by the braces there!" shouted Morgan,
following with apprehension the outstretched finger
of the old boatswain. "Ease down the helm. Brace
up. Lively, lads!"</p>

<p>In a few moments the great ship, her yards braced
sharply up, was headed out to seaward on the starboard
tack. The wind was now blowing a whole gale
and the masts of the ship were bending like whips.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get sail off her, I'm thinking, Hornigold,"
said Morgan.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir, and quick!"</p>

<p>"Aloft!" yelled Morgan, "and take in the
to'gallant s'l's. Close reef the tops'l's and double
reef the courses then."</p>

<p>The shaking shrouds were soon covered with
masses of men, and as the ship was exceedingly well
handled the canvas was promptly snugged down by
the eager crew. Hornigold with young Teach to
assist him went to the helm. Morgan gave his per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>sonal
attention to the manoeuvering of the ship, and
the other officers stationed themselves where they
could best promote and direct the efforts of the seamen.</p>

<p>Thus during the long morning they endeavored to
claw off the lee shore. Morgan luffed the ship
through the heavy squalls which rose to the violence
of a hurricane, with consummate skill. Absolutely
fearless, a master of his profession, he did all with
that ship that mortal man could have done, yet their
situation became more and more precarious. They
had long since passed La Guayra. They had had a
fleeting glimpse of the shipping in the harbor driving
helplessly on shore as they dashed by under the gray
clouds which had overspread the sea. That town was
now hidden from them by a bend of the coast, and
they found themselves in a curious bight of land, extending
far into the ocean in front of them. The
mountains here did not so nearly approach the water-line,
and from the look of the place there appeared
to be a shoal projecting some distance into the ocean
from the point ahead. Some of the buccaneers who
knew these waters confirmed the indications by asserting
the existence of the shoal.</p>

<p>In spite of all that Morgan could do it was quite
evident that they could not weather the shoal on their
present tack. There was not sea-room to wear and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
bear up on the other tack. The vessel, in fact, like
all ships in those days and especially Spanish galleons,
had a tendency to go to leeward like a barrel, and
only Morgan's resourceful seamanship had saved
them from the fatal embraces of the shore long since.
The canvas she was carrying was more than she could
legitimately bear in such a hurricane. If there had
been sea-room Morgan would have stripped her to
bare poles long since, but under the circumstances it
was necessary for him to retain full control and
direction of the ship; so, although he reduced sail to
the lowest point, he still spread a little canvas.</p>

<p>The men were filled with apprehension, not only
for their lives but, such was their covetousness, for
the treasure they had captured, for they stood about
a hundred chances to one of losing the ship. Each
squall that swept down upon them was harder than
the one before. Each time the vessel almost went
over on her beam ends, for Morgan would not luff
until the last moment, since each time that he did so
and lost way temporarily he found himself driven
bodily nearer the land. The men would have
mutinied had it not been patent to the most stupid
mind that their only salvation lay in Morgan. Never
had that despicable villain appeared to better advantage
than when he stood on the weather quarter
overlooking the ship, his long gray hair blown out in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the wind, fighting against a foe whose strength was
not to be measured by the mind of man, for his life
and his ship.</p>

<p>Hornigold and Teach, grasping the wheel assisted
by two of the ablest seamen, were steering the ship
with exquisite precision. Sweat poured from their
brows at the violence of the labor required to control
the massive helm. The men lay to windward on the
deck, or grouped in clusters around the masts, or
hung to the life lines which had been passed in every
direction. At Morgan's side stood Velsers and
Raveneau, prime seamen both.</p>

<p>"What think ye, gentlemen?" asked Morgan, at
last pointing to the point looming fearfully close
ahead of them. "Can we weather it?"</p>

<p>"Never!" answered de Lussan, shaking his head.
"Well, it has been a short cruise and a merry one.
Pity to lose our freightage and lives."</p>

<p>"And you, Velsers?"</p>

<p>"No," said the German, "it can't be done. Why
did we ever come to this cursed coast?"</p>

<p>"Avast that!" cried Morgan, thinking quickly.
"Gentlemen, we'll club-haul the ship."</p>

<p>"The water's too deep, my captain, to give holding
ground to the anchor," urged Raveneau shrugging
his shoulders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"It shoals yonder, I think," answered Morgan.
"We'll hold on until the last minute and then try."</p>

<p>"'Tis wasted labor," growled Velsers.</p>

<p>"And certain death to hold on," added the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Have you anything else to propose, sirs?" asked
Morgan sharply. "We can't tack ship against this
wind and sea. There's no room to wear. What's to
do?"</p>

<p>The men made no answer.</p>

<p>"Forward there!" cried the old buccaneer, and it
was astonishing the force and power with which he
made himself heard in spite of the roar of the wind
and the smash of the sea. "Get the lee anchor off
the bows there! L'Ollonois?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay."</p>

<p>"Run a hawser from the anchor in aft here on the
quarter. We'll club-haul the ship. See the cable
clear for running."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," cried the Frenchman, summoning
the hardiest hands and the most skilful to carry
out his commander's orders.</p>

<p>"Ready it is, sir," answered Hornigold, tightening
his grasp on the spokes and nodding his head to his
superior.</p>

<p>"To the braces, lads! Obey orders sharply. It's
our last chance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The water was roaring and smashing against the
shore not a cable's length away. Usually in those
latitudes it deepened tremendously a short distance
from the low water mark, and there was a grave question
whether or not the anchor, with the scope they
could give it, would reach bottom. At any rate it
must be tried, and tried now. Morgan had held on
as long as he dared. Another minute and they would
strike.</p>

<p>"Down helm!" he shouted. "Flow the head
sheets! Round in on the fore braces, there! Show
that canvas aft!"</p>

<p>The lateen sail on the crossjack yard had been
furled, and Morgan, to force her head around,
directed the after guard to spring into the mizzen-rigging
with a bit of tarpaulin and by exposing it and
their bodies to the wind to act as a sail in assisting
her to head away from the shore.</p>

<p>"Helm-a-lee! Hard-a-lee!" cried Hornigold,
who with his men was grasping the spokes like a
giant.</p>

<p>Slowly the old galleon swung up into the wind, the
waves beating upon her bows with a noise like
crashes of thunder. A moment she hung. She could
go no farther.</p>

<p>"She's in irons! Swing that yard!" roared
Morgan. "Cut and veer away forward!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a splash as the anchor dropped overboard.</p>

<p>"Hands on that hawser!" he shouted. "Everybody
walk away with it!"</p>

<p>The whole crew apparently piled on to the anchor
hawser in the hope of pulling the ship's stern around
so that the wind would take her on the other bow.
She was still hanging in the wind and driving
straight on shore.</p>

<p>"Haul away, for God's sake!" cried Morgan; but
the hawser came in board through their hands with
a readiness and ease that showed the anchor had not
taken the ground. The drag of the cable to the
anchor, however, and the still unspent impetus of the
first swing, turned the galleon's stern slightly to
windward. Her head began slowly to fall off.</p>

<p>"She stays! She makes it!" cried the captain.
"Meet her with the helm! Let go and haul! Cut
away the hawser!"</p>

<p>It had been a tremendous feat of seamanship and
bade fair to be successful. It was yet touch and go,
however, and the breakers were perilously near.
They were writhing around her forefoot now, yet the
wind was at last coming in over the other bow.</p>

<p>"We're safe!" cried Morgan. "Flatten in forward!
Haul aft the sheets and braces!"</p>

<p>At that instant there was a terrific crash heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
above the roar of the tempest. The foretopmast of
the <i>Almirante Recalde</i> carried sharply off at the
hounds. Relieved of the pressure, she shot up into
the wind once more and drove straight into the
seething seas. They were lost with their treasure,
their hopes, and their crimes! At the mercy of
wind and wave!</p>

<p>The men were as quick to see the danger as was
Morgan. They came rushing aft baring their
weapons, pouring curses and imprecations upon him.
He stood with folded arms, a scornful smile on his old
face, looking upon them, Carib watching and ready
by his side. In another second, with a concussion
which threw them all to the deck, the doomed ship
struck heavily upon the sands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">DISCLOSES THE HOPELESS PASSION BETWEEN DONNA MERCEDES
DE LARA AND CAPTAIN DOMINIQUE ALVARADO,
THE COMMANDANTE OF LA GUAYRA</p>

<p>aptain Dominique Alvarado
stood alone on the plaza of the ancient
castle which for over a century had
been the home of the governors of La
Guayra. He was gazing
listlessly down over the
parapet which bordered
the bare sheer precipice
towering above the seaport
town. There was
nothing in his eyes, but
a great deal in his heavy
heart.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;">
<img src="images/011.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Captain Alvarado, who
filled the honorable station
of commandante of the port, was a soldier of
proven courage. The <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> and favorite officer of
his serene highness the Count Alvaro de Lara,
Grandee of Spain and Viceroy of Venezuela, he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
been honored with great responsibilities, which he
had discharged to the satisfaction of his master.
From a military point of view the office of Governor
of La Guayra, which he then filled, was of sufficient
importance to entitle him to high position and much
consideration in the vice-regal court of Caracas.</p>

<p>Of unknown parentage, Alvarado had been received
into the family of the viceroy when an infant.
He had been carefully reared, almost as he had been
de Lara's son, and had been given abundant opportunity
to distinguish himself. In the course of his
short life he had managed to amass a modest fortune
by honorable means. He was young and handsome;
he had been instructed, for the viceroy had early
shown partiality for him, in the best schools in the
New World. His education had been ripened and
polished by a sojourn of several years in Europe, not
only at the court of Madrid but also at that of Versailles,
where the Count de Lara had been sent as
ambassador to the Grand Monarch during a period
in which, for the sake of supervising the education of
his only daughter, he had temporarily absented himself
from his beloved Venezuela. That an unknown
man should have been given such opportunities,
should have been treated with so much consideration,
was sufficient commentary on the unprecedented
kindness of heart of the old Hidalgo who represented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the failing power of His Most Catholic Majesty of
Spain, Carlos II., the Bewitched, in the new world.
Whatever his origin, therefore, he had been brought
up as a Spanish soldier and gentleman, and the old
count was openly proud of him.</p>

<p>With assured station, ample means, increasing
reputation; with youth, health, and personal good
looks, the young Governor should have been a happy
man. But it was easy to see from the heavy frown
upon his sunny face&mdash;for he was that rare thing in
Spain, a blue-eyed blond who at first sight might
have been mistaken for an Englishman&mdash;that his soul
was filled with melancholy. And well it might be,
for Alvarado was the victim of a hopeless passion for
Mercedes de Lara, the Viceroy's daughter, known
from one end of the Caribbean to the other, from her
beauty and her father's station, as the Pearl of Caracas.</p>

<p>Nor was his present sadness due to unrequited
passion, for he was confident that the adoration of
his heart was met with an adequate response from its
object. Indeed, it was no secret to him that Mercedes
loved him with a devotion which matched his
own. It was not that; but her father had announced
his intention to betroth the girl to Don Felipe de
Tobar y Bobadilla, a young gentleman of ancient
lineage and vast wealth, who had been born in Amer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>ica
and was the reputed head in the Western Hemisphere
of the famous family whose name he bore.</p>

<p>The consent of Donna Mercedes to the betrothal
had not been asked. That was a detail which was
not considered necessary by parents in the year of
grace 1685, and especially by Spanish parents. That
she should object to the engagement, or refuse to
carry out her father's plan never crossed the Viceroy's
imagination. That she might love another, was
an idea to which he never gave a thought. It was
the business of a well-brought-up Spanish maiden to
be a passive instrument in the carrying out of her
father's views, especially in things matrimonial, in
which, indeed, love found little room for entrance.
But Donna Mercedes loved Captain Alvarado and
she cared nothing for Don Felipe. Not that Don
Felipe was disagreeable to her, or to any one. He
was a Spanish gentleman in every sense of the word,
handsome, distinguished, proud, and gallant&mdash;but
she did not, could not, love him. To complicate matters
still further de Tobar was Captain Alvarado's
cherished companion and most intimate friend.</p>

<p>The progress of the love affair between Alvarado
and Donna Mercedes had been subjective rather than
objective. They had enjoyed some unusual opportunities
for meeting on account of the station the
former filled in the Viceroy's household and the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
he held in his heart, yet the opportunities for extended
freedom of intercourse between young men
and women of the gentler class in those days, and
especially among Spaniards of high rank, were extremely
limited. The old count took care to see that
his daughter was carefully watched and shielded;
not because he suspected her of anything, for he did
not, but because it was a habit of his people and his
ancestry. The busy life that he led, the many employments
which were thrust upon him, his military
duties, had kept the days of the young soldier very
full, and under the most favorable circumstances he
would have had little time for love making. Fortunately
much time is not required to develop a love
affair, especially in New Spain and near to the
equator.</p>

<p>But though they had enjoyed brief opportunity
for personal intercourse, the very impossibilities of
free communication, the difficulties of meeting, had
but added fuel and fire to their affection. Love had
flamed into these two hearts with all the intensity of
their tropic blood and tropic land. Alvarado's passion
could feed for days and grow large upon the
remembrance of the fragrance of her hand when he
kissed it last in formal salutation. Mercedes' soul
could enfold itself in the recollection of the too ardent
pressure of his lips, the burning yet respectful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
glance he had shot at her, by others unperceived,
when he said farewell. The memory of each sigh the
tropic breeze had wafted to her ears as he walked in
attendance upon her at some formal function of the
court was as much to her as the flower which she had
artfully dropped at his feet and which had withered
over his heart ever since, was to him.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of the exchange of those
sweet nothings that lovers love to dwell upon and the
impossibility of any hoped for end to their love making
intensified their passion. Little or nothing had
been spoken between them, but each knew the other
loved. For the first moment the knowledge of that
glorious fact had sufficed them&mdash;but afterwards they
wanted more. Having tasted, they would fain quaff
deeply. But they could see no way by which to
manage the realization of their dreams.</p>

<p>The situation was complicated in every possible
way for Alvarado. Had he been a man of family
like his friend, de Tobar, he would have gone boldly
to the Viceroy and asked for the hand of his
daughter, in which case he thought he would have
met with no refusal; but, being ignorant of his birth,
having not even a legal right to the name he bore, he
knew that the proud old Hidalgo would rather see his
daughter dead than wedded to him. Of all the ancient
splendors of the Spanish people there was left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
them but one thing of which they could be proud&mdash;their
ancient name. De Lara, who belonged to one
of the noblest and most distinguished families of
the Iberian Peninsula, would never consent to degrade
his line by allying his only daughter to a nobody,
however worthy in other respects the suitor
might prove to be.</p>

<p>Again, had Mercedes' father been any other than
the life-long patron and friend to whom he literally
owed everything that he possessed, such was the impetuosity
of Alvarado's disposition that, at every
hazard, he would have taken the girl by stealth or
force from her father's protection, made her his wife,
and sought an asylum in England or France, or wherever
he could. So desperate was his state of mind,
so overwhelming his love that he would have shrunk
from nothing to win her. Yet just because the Viceroy
had been a father to him, just because he had
loved him, had been unexampled in his kindness and
consideration to him, just because he reposed such
absolutely unlimited confidence in him, the young
man felt bound in honor by fetters that he could not
break.</p>

<p>And there was his friendship for de Tobar. There
were many young gallants about the vice-regal court
who, jealous of Alvarado's favor and envious of his
merits, had not scrupled in the face of his unknown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
origin to sneer, to mock, or to slight&mdash;so far as it was
safe to do either of these things to so brave and able
a soldier. Amid these gilded youths de Tobar with
noble magnanimity and affection had proved himself
Alvarado's staunchest friend. A romantic attachment
had sprung up between the two young men,
and the first confidant of de Tobar's love affairs had
been Alvarado himself. To betray his friend was
almost as bad as to betray his patron. It was not to
be thought of.</p>

<p>Yet how could he, a man in whose blood&mdash;though
it may have been ignoble for aught he knew&mdash;ran
all the passions of his race with the fervor and fire of
the best, a man who loved, as he did, the ground upon
which the Se&ntilde;orita de Lara walked, stand by tamely
and see her given to another, no matter who he
might be? He would have given the fortune which
he had amassed by honorable toil, the fame he had
acquired by brilliant exploits, the power he enjoyed
through the position he had achieved, the weight
which he bore in the councils of New Spain, every
prospect that life held dear to him to solve the
dilemma and win the woman he loved for his wife.</p>

<p>He passed hours in weary isolation on the plaza of
the great castle overlooking the stretched-out town
upon the narrow strand with the ceaseless waves beating
ever upon the shore from the heavenly turquoise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
blue of the Caribbean wavering far into the distant
horizon before him. He spent days and nights,
thinking, dreaming, agonizing, while he wrestled
vainly with the problem. Sometimes he strove to
call to his mind those stern resolutions of duty which
he had laid before himself at the beginning of his
career, and to which he had steadfastly adhered in
the pursuit of his fortunes; and he swore that he
would be true to his ideals, that the trust reposed
in him by the Viceroy should not be betrayed, that
the friendship in which he was held by de Tobar
should never be broken, that he would tear out of his
heart the image of the woman he loved. And then,
again, he knew that so long as that heart kept up its
beating she would be there, and to rob him of her
image meant to take away his life. If there had been
a war, if some opportunity had been vouchsafed him
to pour out, in battle against the enemy, some of the
ardor that consumed him, the situation would have
been ameliorated; but the times were those of profound
peace. There was nothing to occupy his mind
except the routine duties of the garrison.</p>

<p>Spain, under the last poor, crazed, bewitched, degenerate
descendant of the once formidable Hapsburgs,
had reached the lowest depths of ignominy
and decay. Alone, almost, under her flag Venezuela
was well governed&mdash;from the Spanish standpoint,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
that is; from the native American point of view the
rule of even the gentlest of Spaniards had made a
hell on earth of the fairest countries of the new continent.
Of all the cities and garrisons which were
under the sway of the Viceroy de Lara, La Guayra
was the best appointed and cared for. But it did not
require a great deal of the time or attention from so
skilled a commander as Alvarado to keep things in
proper shape. Time, therefore, hung heavily on his
hands. There were few women of rank in the town,
which was simply the port of entry for St. Jago de
Leon across the mountains which rose in tree-clad
slopes diversified by bold precipices for ten thousand
feet back of the palace, and from the commoner sort
of women the young captain held himself proudly
aloof, while his love safeguarded him from the allurement
of the evil and the shameless who flaunted their
iniquity in every seaport on the Caribbean.</p>

<p>On the other side of the mountain range after a
descent of several thousand feet to a beautiful verdant
valley whose altitude tempered the tropic heat
of the low latitude into a salubrious and delightful
climate, lay the palace of the Viceroy and the city
which surrounded it, St. Jago, or Santiago de Leon,
commonly called the City of Caracas.</p>

<p>Many a day had Alvarado turned backward from
the white-walled, red-roofed town spread out at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
feet, baking under the palms, seething in the fierce
heat, as if striving to pierce with his gaze the great
cordilleras, on the farther side of which in the cool
white palace beneath the gigantic ceibas the queen of
his heart made her home. He pictured her at all
hours of the day; he dwelt upon her image, going
over again in his mind each detail of her face and
figure. The perfume of her hand was still fragrant
upon his lips; the sound of her voice, the soft musical
voice of Andalusia, still vibrated in his ear; her burning
glance pierced him even in his dreams like a
sword.</p>

<p>He was mad, mad with love for her, crazed with
hopeless passion. There seemed to be no way out of
his misery but for him to pass his own sword through
his heart, or to throw himself from the precipice, or
to plunge into the hot, cruel blue of the enveloping
Caribbean&mdash;the color of the sea changed in his eye
with his temper, like a woman's mood. Yet he was
young, he hoped in spite of himself. He prayed&mdash;for
he was not old enough to have lost faith&mdash;and he
planned. Besides, he was too brave a soldier to kill
himself, and she was not yet married. She was not
formally betrothed, even; although it was well known
that her father looked favorably upon de Tobar's suit,
no formal announcement had been made of it as yet.
So in spite of his judgment he dreamed&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
thoughts of youth and love are long, long thoughts,
indeed.</p>

<p>That morning the young captain, engrossed in his
emotions, was not aware of the approach of a messenger,
until the clank of the man's sword upon the
stone flags of the plaza caused him to lift his head.
He was a soldier, an officer of the bodyguard of the
Viceroy, and he bore in his hand a letter sealed with
the de Lara coat of arms. The messenger saluted
and handed the packet to the captain.</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening, His Excellency, the Viceroy,
charged me to deliver this letter to you to-day."</p>

<p>"Fadrique," called Alvarado, to a servitor, "a
flagon of wine for the cavalier. By your leave,
sir," he continued with formal politeness, opening
the packet and reading the message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">To The Captain Alvarado, Commandante of La Guayra.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greeting:</span></p>


<p>As one faithful to the fortunes of our family we would crave
your honorable presence at our palace in Santiago to-morrow evening.
In view of your service and devotion, we have done you the
honor to appoint you as one of the witnesses to the formal betrothal
of our daughter, Donna Mercedes, to your friend, Don Felipe
de Tobar. After that, as we have received appeals for help from
the Orinoco country, we propose to lead His Most Catholic Majesty's
Imperial troops thither in person to overawe the natives; and,
reposing full trust in your fidelity and honor, we deign to commit
the Donna Mercedes to your safe keeping in our city of La Guayra,
until we return. Therefore make your preparations accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:16em">
Given under our hand and seal,<br />
<br /></p>
<p style="margin-left:23em"><span class="smcap">De Lara</span>, <i>Viceroy</i>."<br />
</p>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>It had come! The old man, as a last token of his
respect, had nominated him as a witness to the contract
which robbed him forever of hope and happiness.
The young man went white before the keen
eye of the messenger, who, in common with other
officers of the Viceroy's court, suspected what was,
indeed, concealed from no one save the father and
lover. The world swam before his vision. The blue
sea seemed to rise up and meet the green hills until
he could not distinguish the one from the other. His
heart almost stopped its beating, yet summoning his
resolution he recovered himself by an effort that left
him trembling, the sweat beading his forehead.</p>

<p>"Are you in a state for a return journey at once,
se&ntilde;or?" he asked of the young officer.</p>

<p>"At your service, captain."</p>

<p>"That's well. Say to His Excellency, the Viceroy,
that I thank him for the honor he does me. I
shall wait upon him to-morrow and obey his commands."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>HOW DONNA MERCEDES TEMPTED HER LOVER AND HOW
HE STROVE VALIANTLY TO RESIST HER APPEALS</p>

</div>

<p>lvarado was alone in the cabinet of
the Viceroy, to which his rank and the
favor in which His Excellency held him
gave him access at all times.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/012.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He had ridden all day
over the rough road that
winds over the mountains
from La Guayra to
Caracas. The storm
which had rushed down
the mountain-side all
afternoon matched the
tumult in his soul, and
the sheets of rain blown
upon him by the fierce
wind had not cooled the
fever of his agitation. The unusual tempest was one
of the most terrific that had swept over the coast in
years. He had marked as he rode a huge ship far to
seaward, staggering along under shortened canvas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and laboring tremendously in the heavy seas. But
his thoughts were so centered upon the situation in
which he found himself that he had not particularly
noticed the vessel, although passing ships were infrequent
sights off the port of La Guayra. Pale,
haggard, and distraught from his mental struggle he
had crossed the pass at the summit of the mountain
and descended into the fertile valley now adrip with
rain and looking almost cold under the gray sky, and
had presented himself at the palace of the Viceroy.</p>

<p>He had changed his apparel after his reception
and his old sergeant had polished his breastplate
until it fairly blazed with light, for though the occasion
was one of peace he had felt that he could better
sustain his part in the military uniform in which he
had won his only title to consideration. He schooled
himself to go through that part with the resolution of
a Spanish gentleman. Although there was no evidence
of gentle blood save such as was presented by
his actions, he had always cherished the hope that
could the secret of his birth be revealed he would not
be found unfit for the honors that he had won and
the ambitions that he cherished. Consequently his
appearance in the brilliantly lighted hall of the palace
among the gay courtiers resplendent in magnificent
attire, blazing with jewels, threw a somber note
over the proceedings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>It was as a soldier he had won fame and the consideration
of the Viceroy; in no other capacity, so
far as any man knew, had he the right to enter that
assemblage of the rich and well born. It was as a
soldier he would perform that hardest of all duties
which had ever been laid upon him by his friend and
patron, the Governor.</p>

<p>Pale, stern, composed, he stood an iron figure of
repression. So severe was the constraint that he put
upon himself that he had given no sign of his emotion,
even at the near approach of Donna Mercedes,
and the hand which signed his name beneath her
father's as the principal witness was as steady as if
it held merely the sword in some deadly combat. He
endured passively the affectionate greetings of the
happy de Tobar, who was intoxicated at the assurance
afforded by the betrothal of the coming realization
of all his hopes. He sustained with firmness
the confidence of the Viceroy and the admissions de
Lara made to him in private, of his pleasure in the
suitable and fortunate marriage which was there arranged.
He even bore without breaking one long,
piteous appeal which had been shot at him from the
black eyes of the unhappy Mercedes.</p>

<p>To her he seemed preternaturally cold and indifferent.
He was so strong, so brave, so successful.
She had counted upon some interposition from him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
but the snow-capped Andes were no colder than he
appeared, their granite sides no more rigid and unsympathetic.
It was with a feeling almost of anger
and resentment at last that she had signed the betrothal
contract.</p>

<p>But the restraint on the man was more than he
could bear. The cumulative force of the reproach of
the woman he loved, the confidence of the Viceroy,
the rapturous happiness of his best friend, was not to
be endured longer. Pleading indisposition, he early
begged leave to withdraw from the festivities which
succeeded the completion of the betrothal ceremony
and the retirement of the ladies. At the suggestion
of the Viceroy, who said he desired to consult with
him later in the evening, he went into the deserted
cabinet of the latter.</p>

<p>The palace was built in the form of a quadrangle
around an open patio. A balcony ran along the
second story passing the Viceroy's cabinet, beyond
which was his bedroom and beyond that the apartments
of his daughter. The rain had ceased and the
storm had spent itself. It was a calm and beautiful
night, the moon shining with tropic splendor through
the open window dispensed with the necessity of
lights. There was no one in the cabinet when he entered,
and he felt at last able to give way to his
emotion; Mercedes though she was not married was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
now lost to him beyond recourse. After the women
withdrew from the hall with Donna Mercedes there
was no restraint put upon the young nobles, and
from the other side of the patio came the sound of
uproarious revelry and feasting&mdash;his friends and
comrades with generous cheer felicitating the happy
bridegroom that was to be. Alvarado was alone, undisturbed,
forgotten, and likely to remain so. He
put his head upon his hands and groaned in anguish.</p>

<p>"Why should it not have been I?" he murmured.
"Is he stronger, braver, a better soldier? Does he
love her more? O Mother of God! Riches? Can I
not acquire them? Fame? Have I not a large
measure? Birth? Ah, that is it! My father! my
mother! If I could only know! How she looked at
me! What piteous appeal in her eyes! What reproach
when I stood passive cased in iron, with a
breaking heart. O my God! My God! Mercedes!
Mercedes!"</p>

<p>In his anguish he called the name aloud. So absorbed
and preoccupied in his grief had he been that
he was not aware of a figure softly moving along the
balcony in the shadow. He did not hear a footfall
coming through the open window that gave into the
room. He did not realize that he had an auditor to
his words, a witness to his grief, until a touch soft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
as a snowflake fell upon his fair head and a voice for
which he languished whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"You called me; I am come."</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita Mercedes!" he cried, lifting his head
and gazing upon her in startled surprise. "How
came you here?" he added brusquely, catching her
hands with a fierce grasp in the intensity of his emotion
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Is this my greeting?" she answered, surprised
in turn that he had not instantly swept her to his
heart.</p>

<p>She strove to draw herself away, and when he perceived
her intent he opened his hands and allowed
her arms to fall by her side.</p>

<p>"I have been mistaken," she went on piteously,
"I am not wanted."</p>

<p>She turned away and stood full in the silver bar of
the moonlight streaming through the casement. Her
white face shone in the light against the dark background
of the huge empty room&mdash;that face with its
aureole of soft dark hair, the face of a saint, pale yet
not passionless, of the heaven heavenly, yet with just
enough of earthly feeling in her eyes to attest that
she was a very woman after all.</p>

<p>"Go not," he cried, catching her again and drawing
her back.</p>

<p>Gone were his resolutions, shattered was his deter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>mination,
broken was his resistance. She was here
before him, at all hazards he would detain her. They
were alone together, almost for the first time in their
lives. It was night, the balmy wind blew softly, the
moonlight enveloped them. Such an opportunity
would never come again. It was madness. It was
fatal. No matter. She should not go now.</p>

<p>"I heard you," she murmured, swaying toward
him. "I heard&mdash;you seemed to be&mdash;suffering. I do
not know why&mdash;something drew me on. You whispered&mdash;you
were speaking&mdash;I&mdash;listened. I came
nearer. Was your heart breaking, too? Despise
me!"</p>

<p>She put her face in her hands. It was a confession
she made. A wave of shame swept over her.</p>

<p>"Despise you? Ah, God help me, I love you!"</p>

<p>And this time he gathered her in his arms, and
drew her back into the deeper shadow.</p>

<p>"And you were so cold," she whispered. "I
looked at you. I begged you with all my soul before
I signed. You did nothing, nothing! O Mother of
God, is there no help?"</p>

<p>"Dost love me?"</p>

<p>"With all my soul," she answered.</p>

<p>"Poor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Obscure&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lowly&mdash;perhaps ignobly born&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, love, these are mere words to me. Rich or
poor, high or low, noble or ignoble, thou only hast
my heart. It beats and throbs only for thee. I
have thought upon thee, dreamed upon thee, loved
thee. I can not marry Don Felipe. I, too, have the
pride of the de Lara's. My father shall find it. I
signed that contract under duress. You would do
nothing. Oh, Alvarado, Alvarado, wilt thou stand
by and let me be taken into the arms of another?
But no, I shall die before that happens."</p>

<p>"Donna Mercedes," cried the unhappy young
man, "I love thee, I adore thee, I worship thee with
all my heart and soul! Were it not a coward's act
I would have plunged my dagger into my breast ere
I witnessed that betrothal to-night."</p>

<p>"Thou shouldst first have sheathed it in mine,"
she whispered. "But could'st find no better use for
thy weapon than that?"</p>

<p>"Would you have me kill Don Felipe?"</p>

<p>"No, no, but defend me with it. There are hidden
recesses in the mountains. Your soldiers worship
you. Take me away, away into the undiscovered
countries to the southward. A continent is before
you. We will find a new Mexico, carve out a new
Peru with your sword, though I want nothing but to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
be with you, alone with you, my soldier, my lover,
my king!"</p>

<p>"But your plighted word?"</p>

<p>"'Tis nothing. My heart was plighted to you.
That is enough. Let us go, we may never have the
chance again," she urged, clinging to him.</p>

<p>A fearful struggle was going on in Alvarado's
breast. What she proposed was the very thing he
would have attempted were the circumstances other
than they were. But his patron, his friend, his military
duty, his honor as a soldier&mdash;the sweat beaded
his forehead again. He had made up his mind at
the betrothal to give her up. He had abandoned
hope; he had put aside possibilities, for he could see
none. But here she was in his arms, a living, breathing,
vital, passionate figure, her heart beating against
his own, pleading with him to take her away. Here
was love with all its witchery, with all its magic, with
all its power, attacking the defenses of his heart;
and the woman whom he adored as his very life, with
all the passion in his being, was urging, imploring,
begging him to take her away. He was weakening,
wavering, and the woman who watched him realized
it and added fuel to the flame.</p>

<p>"The love I bear your father!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Should it bind where mine breaks? I am his
daughter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Don Felipe is my personal friend."</p>

<p>"And my betrothed, but I hesitate not."</p>

<p>"My oath as a soldier&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And mine as a woman."</p>

<p>"Gratitude&mdash;duty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Alvarado, you love me not!" she cried.
"These are the strongest. I have dreamed a dream.
Lend me your dagger. There shall be no awakening.
Without you I can not bear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As she spoke she plucked the dagger from the belt
of the young soldier, lifted the point gleaming in the
moonlight and raised it to her heart. He caught it
instantly.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he cried. "Give back the weapon."</p>

<p>The poniard fell from her hand.</p>

<p>"Thou hast taken me, I thank thee," she murmured,
thinking the battle won as he swept her once
more in his arms. This time he bent his head to her
upturned face and pressed kiss after kiss upon the
trembling lips. It was the first time, and they
abandoned themselves to their transports with all the
fire of their long restrained passion.</p>

<p>"And is this the honor of Captain Alvarado?"
cried a stern voice as the Viceroy entered the room.
"My officer in whom I trusted? Death and fury!
Donna Mercedes, what do you here?"</p>

<p>"The fault is mine," said Alvarado, stepping be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>tween
the woman he loved and her infuriated father.
"I found Donna Mercedes in the cabinet when I
came in. She strove to fly. I detained her&mdash;by
force. I poured into her ear a tale of my guilty passion.
Mine is the fault. She repulsed me. She
drove me off."</p>

<p>"The dagger at your feet?"</p>

<p>"She snatched it from me and swore to bury it
in her heart unless I left her. I alone am guilty."</p>

<p>He lied instantly and nobly to save the woman's
honor.</p>

<p>"Thou villain, thou false friend!" shouted the
Viceroy, whipping out his sword.</p>

<p>He was beside himself with fury, but there was a
characteristic touch of magnanimity about his next
action; so handsome, so splendid, so noble, in spite of
his degrading confession, did the young man look,
that he gave him a chance.</p>

<p>"Draw your sword, Captain Alvarado, for as I
live I shall run you through!"</p>

<p>Alvarado's hand went to his belt, he unclasped it
and threw it aside.</p>

<p>"There lies my sword. I am dishonored," he
cried. "Strike, and end it all."</p>

<p>"Not so, for Christ's sake!" screamed Mercedes,
who had heard as if in a daze. "He hath not told
the truth. He hath lied for me. I alone am guilty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I heard him praying here in the still night and I came
in, not he. I threw myself into his arms. I begged
him to take me away. He spoke of his love and
friendship for you, for Don Felipe, his honor, his
duty. I did indeed seize the dagger, but because
though he loved me he would still be true. On my
head be the shame. Honor this gentleman, my
father, as I&mdash;love him."</p>

<p>She flung herself at her father's feet and caught
his hand.</p>

<p>"I love him," she sobbed, "I love him. With all
the power, all the intensity, all the pride of the greatest
of the de Laras I love him."</p>

<p>"Is this true, Captain Alvarado?"</p>

<p>"Would God she had not said so," answered the
young man gloomily.</p>

<p>"Is it true?"</p>

<p>"I can not deny it, my lord, and yet I am the
guilty one. I was on the point of yielding. Had you
not come in we should have gone away."</p>

<p>"Yet you had refused?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;hesitated."</p>

<p>"Refused my daughter! My God!" whispered
the old man. "And you, shameless girl, you forced
yourself upon him? Threw yourself into his arms?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I loved him. Did'st never love in thine
own day, my father? Did'st never feel that life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
itself were as nothing compared to what beats and
throbs here?"</p>

<p>"But Don Felipe?"</p>

<p>"He is a gallant gentleman. I love him not. Oh,
sir, for God's sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Press your daughter no further, Don Alvaro,
she is beside herself," gasped out Alvarado hoarsely.
"'Tis all my fault. I loved her so deeply that she
caught the feeling in her own heart. When I am gone
she will forget me. You have raised me from obscurity,
you have loaded me with honor, you have
given me every opportunity&mdash;I will be true. I will
be faithful to you. 'Twill be death, but I hope it
may come quickly. Misjudge me not, sweet lady.
Happiness smiles not upon my passion, sadness marks
me for her own. I pray God 'twill be but for a little
space. Give me some work to do that I may kill
sorrow by losing my life, my lord. And thou, Donna
Mercedes, forget me and be happy with Don Felipe."</p>

<p>"Never, never!" cried the girl.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and came nearer to him.
Her father stood by as if stunned. She laid her
arms around Alvarado's neck. She looked into her
lover's eyes.</p>

<p>"You love me and I love you. What matters anything
else?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, my lord!" cried Alvarado, staring
at the Viceroy, "kill me, I pray, and end it all!"</p>

<p>"Thou must first kill me," cried Mercedes, extending
her arms across her lover's breast.</p>

<p>"Donna Mercedes," said her father, "thou hast
put such shame upon the name and fame of de Lara
as it hath never borne in five hundred years. Thou
hast been betrothed to an honorable gentleman. It
is my will that the compact be carried out."</p>

<p>"O my God! my God!" cried the unhappy girl,
sinking into a chair. "Wilt Thou permit such things
to be?"</p>

<p>"And, Alvarado," went on the old man, not heeding
his daughter's piteous prayer. "I know not thy
parentage nor to what station thou wert born, but I
have marked you from that day when, after Panama,
they brought you a baby into my house. I have
watched you with pride and joy. Whatever responsibility
I have placed before you, you have met it.
Whatever demand that hard circumstances have
made upon you, you have overcome it. For every
test there counts a victory. You have done the State
and me great service, none greater than to-night.
With such a temptation before thee, that few men
that I have come in contact with in my long life
could have resisted, you have thrown it aside. You
and your honor have been tried and not found want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ing.
Whatever you may have been I know you now
to be the finest thing on God's earth, a Spanish
gentleman! Nay, with such evidence of your character
I could, were it possible, have set aside the
claims of birth and station&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my father, my father!" interrupted the girl
joyously.</p>

<p>"And have given you Donna Mercedes to wife."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But 'tis too late. The betrothal has been made;
the contract signed; my word is passed. In solemn
attestation before our Holy Church I have promised
to give my daughter to Don Felipe de Tobar. Nothing
can be urged against the match&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But love," interjected Mercedes; "that is wanting."</p>

<p>"It seems so," returned the Viceroy. "And yet,
where duty and honor demand, love is nothing. Donna
Mercedes, thou hast broken my heart. That a
Spanish gentlewoman should have shown herself so
bold! I could punish thee, but thou art mine all. I
am an old man. Perhaps there is some excuse in
love. I will say no more. I will e'en forgive thee,
but I must have your words, both of you, that there
shall be no more of this; that no other word of affection
for the other shall pass either lip, forever, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
that you will be forever silent about the events of
this night."</p>

<p>"Speak thou first, Captain Alvarado," said the
girl.</p>

<p>"You have loved me," cried the young man, turning
toward Donna Mercedes, "and you have trusted
me," bowing to the old man. "Here are two appeals.
God help me, I can not hesitate. Thou shalt have
my word. Would this were the last from my lips."</p>

<p>"And he could promise; he could say it!" wailed
the broken-hearted woman. "O my father, he loves
me not! I have been blind! I promise thee, on the
honor of a de Lara! I have leaned upon a broken
reed."</p>

<p>"Never," cried the old man, "hath he loved thee
so truly and so grandly as at this moment."</p>

<p>"It may be, it may be," sobbed the girl, reeling as
she spoke. "Take me away. 'Tis more than I can
bear."</p>

<p>Then she sank prostrate, senseless between the two
men who loved her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class="center">WHEREIN CAPTAIN ALVARADO PLEDGES HIS WORD TO THE
VICEROY OF VENEZUELA, THE COUNT ALVARO DE LARA,
AND TO DON FELIPE DE TOBAR, HIS FRIEND</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">
<img src="images/w.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>e must have assistance," cried the Viceroy
in dismay. "Alvarado, do you go
and summon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Into the women's apartments, my
lord?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I will go. Watch you here. I trust you,
you see," answered the old man, promptly running
through the window and out on the balcony toward
the apartments of his daughter. He went quickly
but making no noise, for he did not wish the events
of the evening to become public.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Alvarado, resisting the temptation
to take the prostrate form of his love in his arms and
cover her cold face with kisses, knelt down by her
side and began chafing her hands. He thought it no
breach of propriety to murmur her name. Indeed
he could not keep the words from his lips. Almost
instantly the Viceroy departed there was a commotion
in the outer hall. There was a knock on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
door, repeated once and again, and before Alvarado
could determine upon a course of action, Don Felipe
burst into the room followed by Se&ntilde;ora Agapida, the
duenna of Donna Mercedes.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency&mdash;&mdash;" cried the old woman in
agitation, "I missed the Se&ntilde;orita. I have
searched&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who is this?" interrupted de Tobar, stepping
over to where Alvarado still knelt by the prostrate
girl. "'Tis not the Viceroy!" He laid his hand on
the other man's shoulder and recoiled in surprise.</p>

<p>"Dominique!" he exclaimed. "What do you
here and who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother of God!" shrieked the duenna. "There
lies the Donna Mercedes!"</p>

<p>"She is hurt?" asked Felipe, for the moment his
surprise at the presence of Alvarado lost in his
anxiety for his betrothal.</p>

<p>"I know not," answered the distracted old woman.</p>

<p>"She lives," said Alvarado, rising to his feet and
facing his friend. "She hath but fainted."</p>

<p>"Water!" said Se&ntilde;ora Agapida.</p>

<p>Both men started instantly to hand her the carafe
that stood on a table near by. Don Felipe was nearer
and got it first.</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;ora Agapida loosened the dress of the young
woman and sprinkled her face and hands with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
water, laying her head back upon the floor as she did
so and in a moment the girl opened her eyes. In
the darkness of the room, for no lamp had as yet
been lighted, she had not recognized in her bewilderment
who was bending over her, for Alvarado had
forced himself to draw back, yielding his place to de
Tobar as if by right.</p>

<p>"Alvarado!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"She lives," said Don Felipe, with relief and jealousy
mingled in his voice, and then he turned and
faced the other.</p>

<p>"And now, Se&ntilde;or Alvarado, perhaps you will be
able to explain how you came to be here alone, at
this hour of night, with my betrothed, and why she
calls thy name! By St. Jago, sir, have you dared to
offer violence to this lady?"</p>

<p>His hand went to his sword. To draw it was the
work of a moment. He menaced the young soldier
with the point.</p>

<p>"I could kill you as you stand there!" he cried in
growing rage. "But the memory of our ancient
friendship stays my hand. You shall have a chance.
Where is your weapon!"</p>

<p>"Strike, if it please you. I want nothing but
death," answered Alvarado, making no effort whatever
to defend himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hast deserved it at my hands, then?" exclaimed
the now infuriated de Tobar.</p>

<p>"Stay!" interrupted the Viceroy re-entering the
room. "What means this assault upon my captain?
Donna Mercedes?"</p>

<p>"She revives," said the duenna.</p>

<p>"Is it thou, Se&ntilde;ora?" said the Viceroy. "I
sought thee unavailingly."</p>

<p>"Your Highness," said the old woman, "I missed
the se&ntilde;orita and found her here."</p>

<p>"And how came you unbidden into my private
cabinet, Don Felipe?"</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, Se&ntilde;ora Agapida found me in
the corridor. She was distraught over her lady's absence.
We knocked. There was no answer. We
entered. I crave your pardon, but it was well I
came, for I found my betrothed and my best friend
alone, together, here," he pointed gloomily. "A
Spanish gentleman alone at this hour of the night
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" thundered the Viceroy. "Would'st
asperse my daughter's name? Darest thou&mdash;By
heaven, you hold a weapon in your hand. I am old
but&mdash;Guard thyself!" he called, whipping out his
sword with astonishing agility.</p>

<p>"I can not fight with you," said de Tobar lowering
his point, "but for God's sake, explain!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Donna Mercedes is as pure as heaven,"
asserted Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Then why did you bid me strike and stand defenseless
a moment since?"</p>

<p>"Because I love her and she is yours."</p>

<p>"Death!" shouted de Tobar. "Take up thy
sword!"</p>

<p>"Stay," broke in the old Viceroy quickly, "keep
silent, Alvarado, let me tell it all. I am her father.
I would consult with the captain upon the journey of
the morrow and other matters of state. With us
here was my daughter. Is there aught to provoke
thy jealousy or rage in this? Overcome by&mdash;er&mdash;the
events of the day she fainted. One of us had to go
for aid. 'Twas not meet that the young man should
go to the women's apartments, I left them together."</p>

<p>"Alone?" queried de Tobar.</p>

<p>"Ay, alone. One was my daughter, a de Lara,
and she was senseless. The other was almost my
son, I knew him. He had proved himself. I could
trust him."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, I thank you," cried Alvarado,
seizing the hand of the old nobleman and carrying it
to his lips.</p>

<p>"You said you loved her," said de Tobar turning
to Alvarado.</p>

<p>"And so I do," answered Alvarado, "but who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
could help it? It is an infection I have caught from
my friend."</p>

<p>"Have you spoken words of love to her? Have
you pleaded with her? Did you meet here by appoint?"</p>

<p>"Don Felipe," cried Donna Mercedes, who had
kept silent at first hardly comprehending and then
holding her breath at the d&eacute;nouement. "Hear me.
Captain Alvarado's manner to me has been coldness
itself. Nay, he scarcely manifested the emotion of a
friend."</p>

<p>She spoke with a bitterness and resentment painfully
apparent to Alvarado, but which in his bewilderment
Don Felipe did not discover.</p>

<p>"I swear to you, se&ntilde;or," she went on cunningly,
"until this hour I never heard him say those words,
'I love you.' But this scene is too much for me, I
can not bear it. Help me hence. Nay, neither of
you gentlemen. With Se&ntilde;ora Agapida's aid I can
manage. Farewell. When you wish to claim me,
Don Felipe, the betrothal shall be carried out and I
shall be yours. Good-night."</p>

<p>De Tobar sprang after her and caught her hand,
raising it respectfully to his lips.</p>

<p>"Now, se&ntilde;or," he cried turning back, "we can
discuss this question unhindered by the presence of
the lady. You said you loved her. How dare you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a man of no birth, whose very name is an assumption,
lift your eyes so high?"</p>

<p>"This from you, my friend," cried Alvarado,
turning whiter than ever at this insult.</p>

<p>"Sir," interposed the voice of the Viceroy,
"restrain yourself. 'Tis true we know not the birth
or name of this young man whom I have honored
with my confidence, upon whom you have bestowed
your friendship. Perchance it may be nobler than
thine, or mine, perchance not so, but he hath ever
shown himself&mdash;and I have watched him from his
youth&mdash;a gentleman, a Spanish gentleman whom all
might emulate. You wrong him deeply&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he loved her."</p>

<p>"What of that?" answered the Viceroy.</p>

<p>"Ay," cried Alvarado. "I do love her, and that
I make no secret of it from you proves the sincerity
of my soul. Who could help loving her, and much
less a man in my position, for, in so far as was proper
in a maiden, she has been kind to me since I was a
boy. I cherish no hopes, no dreams, no ambitions.
I locked my passion within my breast and determined
to keep it there though it killed me. To-night, with
her helpless at my feet, thrown on my pity, it was
wrung from me; but I swear to you by my knightly
honor, by that friendship that hath subsisted between
us of old, that from this hour those words shall never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
pass my lips again; that from this hour I shall be as
silent as before. Oh, trust me! I am sadly torn.
Thou hast all, I nothing! If thou canst not trust me&mdash;I
bade you strike before, strike now and end it all.
What supports life when love is denied? Friendship
and duty. If these be taken from me, I am poor indeed,
and I'd liefer die than live in shame. Your
Excellency, bid him strike."</p>

<p>"Thy life is not thine," answered the older man,
"it belongs to Spain. We have fallen on evil times
and thy country needs thine arm. Thou hast said
aright. Se&ntilde;or de Tobar," he cried, "he is thy friend.
Take him back to thy affection. I am an old man
and a father, but were I young and one so beautiful
crossed my path as Donna Mercedes&mdash;by Our Lady
he hath excuse for anything! He speaks the truth,
though it be to his own hurt. Canst stand unmoved,
se&ntilde;or, in thy happiness before such misery as that?"</p>

<p>"Dominique, forgive me!" cried de Tobar, "I
was wrong. I am ashamed. Thou couldst not help
it. I forgive thee. I love thee still."</p>

<p>He made as if to embrace his friend, but Alvarado
held him off.</p>

<p>"Wilt trust me fully, absolutely, entirely?"</p>

<p>"With all my life," answered de Tobar.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt be tried," said the Viceroy. "We
march toward the Orinoco in three days. I had pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>posed
to establish Donna Mercedes at La Guayra
under care of Alvarado."</p>

<p>"Not now, your Excellency," cried the young
man.</p>

<p>"Nay, I shall, provided de Tobar is willing."</p>

<p>"A test, a test!" answered that young man.
"Gladly do I welcome it. As thou lovest me, and
as I love thee, guard thou my betrothed."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, take me with you to the Orinoco,
and let Don Felipe stay at home with Donna
Mercedes in La Guayra."</p>

<p>"I am no experienced soldier to command a
town," protested de Tobar.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Viceroy, "it shall be as we have
said. Wilt take the charge?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and defend it with all my soul!" answered
Alvarado firmly.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Alvarado and Don Felipe, you have shown
yourselves true Spanish gentlemen this night, hidalgos
of whom Spain may well be proud," cried the
Viceroy in pleased and proud content. "To you, de
Tobar, I shall give my daughter with assurance and
pride, and were there another to bear my name I
could wish no better husband for her than you, my
poor friend. Now, the hour is late, I have much to
say to Alvarado. Don Felipe, you will pardon me?
Good-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-night, your Excellency," promptly returned
de Tobar. "I shall see you in the morning,
Dominique, ere you set forth for La Guayra. I love
thee and trust thee, my friend."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class="center">SHOWS HOW DONNA MERCEDES CHOSE DEATH RATHER THAN
GIVE UP CAPTAIN ALVARADO, AND WHAT BEFEL
THEM ON THE ROAD OVER THE MOUNTAINS</p>

</div>

<p>hey set forth early in the morning.
There was a cool freshness in the air
from the storm of the day before and if
they wished to avoid the necessity of
traveling in the heat of
the day early departure
was necessary. Although
the season was summer
in a tropic land not far
from the equator, the altitude
of Caracas lowered
the ordinary temperature
to an agreeable degree,
but after they crossed
the pass of La Veta and
began the descent toward La Guayra they would be
within the confines of one of the hottest localities on
the face of the globe.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/014.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Early as it was, the Viceroy and his officers, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>cluding,
of course, de Tobar, were assembled in the
patio to bid the travelers godspeed. While de Lara
gave a few parting directions to Alvarado, Don
Felipe took advantage of the opportunity and of his
position as the publicly affianced of Donna Mercedes
to address her a few words in farewell, which she
received with listless indifference that did not bode
well for the future happiness of either of them. The
final preparations were soon over. Don Felipe lifted
Donna Mercedes to the saddle of her Spanish jennet;
some of the other gentlemen assisted the Se&ntilde;ora
Agapida to the back of the sure-footed mule which
she had elected as her mount; Alvarado saluted and
sprang to the back of his mettlesome barb, and, followed
by a half-dozen troopers who constituted the
escort, the rear being brought up by servants with
pack mules carrying the personal baggage of the two
ladies, the little cavalcade moved off, the gentlemen
in the Viceroy's suite standing bareheaded in the
doorway as they disappeared under the trees and began
the ascent toward the pass.</p>

<p>With the whispered assurance of his friend, "I
trust you," still ringing in his ear, with the sound of
the Viceroy's stern voice, "I know not what danger
could befall my child in this peaceful time, but I
have a premonition that something threatens, and I
charge you to guard her welfare and happiness with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
your life," still fresh in his mind, Alvarado, whose
white, haggard face showed that he had passed a
sleepless night, rode at the head of the column.
Some distance in front of him rode a trooper, for
there were even then thieves, wandering bands of
masterless men who levied bloody toll on travelers
from the capitol whenever they got opportunity.
Next to the captain came the sergeant of the little
guard, then the two women, followed closely by two
more of the soldiers, after that the little pack train,
which he had ordered to close up and keep in touch
after they left the city, and, last of all, the two remaining
soldiers to bring up the rear.</p>

<p>The soldiers, servants, and muleteers were in high
spirits. There was little danger to be apprehended,
for the party was too strong to fear attack from any
of the brigand bodies, and the military order of
march was taken more as a matter of habit than from
any special need. The day was pleasant, the scenery,
though familiar, was at the same time grand and
beautiful, and they were happy&mdash;all, that is, except
Donna Mercedes, the duenna, and Alvarado.</p>

<p>The worthy Se&ntilde;ora Agapida with womanly
shrewdness more than suspected the true state of
affairs. Indeed, Mercedes, who loved the old woman,
who had been as a mother to her, her own mother
having died when she was a mere child, had scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
taken the trouble to conceal her misery, and the old
woman's heart was wrung whenever she looked at
the drooping figure at her side. She would fain have
brought the flush of happiness to the face of the girl
she loved, by throwing her into the arms of Alvarado;
but, as a distant connection of the de Laras herself,
the worthy dame had her own notions of pride,
and her honor would not permit her to do anything
for which the Viceroy could properly fault her. The
ancient duenna was an indifferent horsewoman, too,
and although she had the easiest and surest footed
beast of the party she journeyed with many sighs and
groans of dissatisfaction. She bravely made an effort
at first to cheer up her charge, but soon perceived
that the task was beyond her powers, so she rode
along in a silence unbroken save by her frequent
ejaculations.</p>

<p>When Mercedes had met Alvarado early in the
morning she had acknowledged his profound salutation
with the curtest and coldest of nods. She was
furiously and bitterly angry with him; for, between
duty, honor, friendship, and her love, he had not
chosen her. She knew that he loved her. She had
known it a long time, and, if she had the slightest
doubt, the sincerity with which he had spoken the
night before, the fierce, passionate fervor of the
kisses that he had pressed upon her lips, his utter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
abandonment to his passion, had more than satisfied
her. Yet, when she had offered to throw everything
to the winds&mdash;love, duty, obedience, if he would only
take her away&mdash;he had hesitated. With her, a
woman who had all Venezuela at her feet, held in his
arms, he had repulsed her, refused her! He had
heard the open confession of her overwhelming love
for him, and he had resisted her! With the feel of
her heart beating against his own, he had strained
her to his breast and prated of honor and duty!</p>

<p>She was mad with anger and disappointment. She
loathed him; she hated him; she raged against him
in her heart. Why had he not killed de Tobar where
he stood, seized her in his arms, braved the anger of
her father, and galloped away&mdash;anywhere out into
the mysterious southland where they could be together?
Well and good, she would marry Don
Felipe. She would assume a happiness that she
could not feel and kill him with the sight of it. He
had disdained her; he should suffer, suffer in proportion
to his love, such torments as he had made her
suffer last night&mdash;shame, disappointment, indignation.</p>

<p>She had not slept the entire night, either, thinking
these things, yet it had not all been pain. How nobly
he had lied to save her! He, to whom a lie was
worse than death. He had tried to assume dishonor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
for her sake. He loved her; yes, there was no
doubt of it. She closed her eyes with the thought
and her whole being was filled with exquisite anguish.
He loved her, he was made for her, yet when he
might have taken her he refused. De Tobar was
indeed a brave and gallant gentleman, but his qualities
were as moonlight to the sunlight compared to
those of Alvarado. In spite of herself, though the
mere suggestion of it angered her, she found herself
obliged to grant that there was something noble in
that position he had assumed which so filled her with
fury. It was not, with him, a question of loving
duty and honor more than herself, but it was a question
of doing duty and preserving honor, though the
heart broke and the soul was rent in the effort.</p>

<p>Because he had the strength to do these things,
not to betray his friend, not to return ingratitude to
her father, who had been a father to him too, not to
be false to his military honor; because he had the
strength to control himself, she felt dimly how strong
his passion might be. In spite of her careful avoidance
of his eyes, her cold demeanor, that morning,
she had marked the haggard, pale face of the young
soldier to whom she had given her heart, which
showed that he, too, had suffered. She watched him
as he rode, superb horseman that he was, at the head
of the little cavalcade. Tall, straight, erect, grace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ful,
she was glad that he rode in advance with his
back to her, so that she might follow him with her
eyes, her gaze unheeded by any but Se&ntilde;ora Agapida,
and for her she did not care.</p>

<p>As he turned at intervals to survey his charges, to
see that all were keeping closed up and in order, by
furtive glances she could mark with exultation the
pallor that had taken the place of the ruddy hue on
the fair cheek of her lover. She could even note the
black circles under the blue eyes beneath the sunny
hair, so different from her own midnight crown.</p>

<p>How this man loved her! She could see, and
know, and feel. Great as was her own passion, it did
not outweigh his feeling. A tempest was raging in
his bosom. The girl who watched him could mark
the progress of the storm in the deeps of his soul, for
his face told the tale of it.</p>

<p>And, indeed, his thoughts were bitter. What
must she think of him? He had been a fool. Happiness
had been his for the taking, and he had thrown
it away. Why had he not brushed de Tobar out of
his path, silenced the Viceroy&mdash;no, not by death, but
by binding him fast, and then taken the woman he
loved and who loved him, for she had proved it by
her utter abandonment of herself to him? Those
old soldiers who had served him for many years
would have followed him wherever he led. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Viceroy's arm was long, but they could have found
a haven where they could have been together. God
had made them for each other and he had refused.
He had thrust her aside. He had pushed the cup of
happiness from his own lips with his own hand.</p>

<p>Honor was a name, duty an abstraction, gratitude
a folly. What must she think of him? There had
been no reservation in her declaration of affection.
For him she was willing to give up all, and though
he had vowed and protested in his heart that there
was nothing she could ask of him that he would not
grant her, he had been able to do nothing after all.</p>

<p>He wished it was all to do over again. Now it was
too late. To the chains of duty, honor, gratitude,
had been added that of his plighted word. Knowing
his love, de Tobar, his friend, had trusted him.
Knowing his daughter's love, the Viceroy had also
trusted him. He was locked with fetters, bound and
sealed, helpless. And yet the temptation grew with
each hour. He had suspected, he had dreamed, he
had hoped, that Mercedes loved him, now he was sure
of it. Oh, what happiness might have been his!</p>

<p>What was this mystery about his birth? He had
been picked up a baby in a deserted village outside of
Panama. He had been found by the young Count
de Lara, who had led his troops to the succor of that
doomed town, which, unfortunately, he had only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
reached after the buccaneers had departed. Search
had been made for his parents but without success.
The Viceroy finding none to claim the bright-faced
baby, had given him a name and had caused him to
be brought up in his own household. There was
nothing in his apparel to distinguish him save the
exquisite fineness and richness of the material.
Thrown around his neck had been a curiously
wrought silver crucifix on a silver chain, and that
crucifix he had worn ever since. It lay upon his
breast beneath his clothing now. It was the sole object
which connected him with his past.</p>

<p>Who had been his father, his mother? How had
a baby so richly dressed come to be abandoned in a
small obscure village outside the walls of Panama,
which would have escaped the ravages of the buccaneers
on account of its insignificance, had it not
lain directly in their backward path. They had
destroyed it out of mere wantonness.</p>

<p>And there was another thought which often came
to him and caused his cheeks to burn with horror.
If, as his clothing had indicated, he had been the
child of wealth, did not his obscure position indicate
that he was at the same time the child of shame?</p>

<p>Since he had reached man's estate he had thought
of these things often and had prayed that in some
way, at some time, the mystery might be solved, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the suspense was worse than any assurance, however
dreadful. He had often thought with longing
upon his father, his mother. This morning in the
bitterness of his heart he cursed them for the situation
in which he found himself. He despaired at
last of ever finding out anything. What mattered
it now? He might be of the proudest and most
honorable lineage in New Spain, a Soto-Mayor, a
Bobadilla, even a de Guzman. It would advantage
him nothing since he had lost Mercedes. In spite
of himself he groaned aloud, and the girl riding a
little distance behind him heard the sound of anguish
in his voice.</p>

<p>Her heart, which had been yearning toward him
with increasing force, was stirred within her bosom.</p>

<p>"Ride thou here," she said suddenly to Se&ntilde;ora
Agapida, "I go forward to speak with Captain Alvarado."</p>

<p>"But, se&ntilde;orita, thy father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it not permitted that I speak with the captain
of the soldiery who escort me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if I am by."</p>

<p>"I do not choose to have it so," replied Mercedes,
with all the haughtiness of her father. "Remain
here. I will return presently."</p>

<p>Brushing her aside with an imperious wave of her
hand and a threatening glance before which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
poor duenna quailed, for her charge had never
shown such spirit before, Mercedes struck her Spanish
jennet with the whip she carried, passed around
the intervening soldier, who courteously gave way
to her, and reined in her steed by Alvarado's horse.
So close, indeed, was she to the captain that she
almost touched him. It was good to see the light
leap in his eyes, the flush come into his pale cheek
as he became aware of her presence.</p>

<p>"Donna Mercedes!" he cried in surprise. "Is
anything wrong? Where is the Se&ntilde;ora Agapida?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is wrong. I left her there."</p>

<p>"Shall I summon her?"</p>

<p>"Art afraid to speak to me, to a woman, alone,
sir captain?"</p>

<p>"Nay, se&ntilde;orita, but 'tis unseemly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou lesson me in manners, master soldier?"
cried the girl haughtily.</p>

<p>"God forbid, lady, but thy father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He laid no injunction upon me that I should not
speak to you, sir. Is that forbidden?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what, sir? It is your own weakness you
fear? You were strong enough last night. Have
you, by chance&mdash;repented?"</p>

<p>There was such a passionate eagerness in her
voice, and such a leaping hope for an affirmative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
answer in the glance she bent upon him, that he
could scarce sustain the shock of it. His whole
soul had risen to meet hers, coming as she came.
He trembled at her propinquity. The voice of the
girl thrilled him as never before.</p>

<p>The sergeant who followed them, out of respect
for their confidences checked the pace of his troop
horse somewhat and the two advanced some distance
from him out of earshot. The unhappy duenna
watched them with anxious eyes, but hesitated to
attempt to join them. Indeed, the way was blocked
for such an indifferent horsewoman as she by the
adroit man&oelig;uvres of the sergeant. He was devoted
to his young commander and he had surmised the
state of affairs also. He would have had no scruples
whatever in facilitating a meeting, even an elopement.
The two lovers, therefore, could speak unobserved,
or at least unheard by any stranger.</p>

<p>"Lady," said Alvarado at last, "I am indeed
afraid. You make the strong, weak. Your beauty&mdash;forgive
me&mdash;masters me. For God's sake, for
Christ, His Mother, tempt me not! I can stand no
more&mdash;" he burst forth with vehemence.</p>

<p>"What troubles thee, Alvarado?" she said
softly.</p>

<p>"Thou&mdash;and my plighted word."</p>

<p>"You chose honor and duty last night when you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
might have had me. Art still in the same mind?"</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita, this subject is forbidden."</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the girl, "I absolve you from all
injunctions of silence. I, too, am a de Lara, and in
my father's absence the head of the house. The
duty thou hast sworn to him thou owest me. Art
still in the same mind as last night, I say?"</p>

<p>"Last night I was a fool!"</p>

<p>"And this morning?"</p>

<p>"I am a slave."</p>

<p>"A slave to what? To whom?"</p>

<p>"Donna Mercedes," he cried, turning an imploring
glance upon her, "press me no further. Indeed,
the burden is greater than I can bear."</p>

<p>"A slave to whom?" she went on insistently,
seeing an advantage and pressing it hard. She was
determined that she would have an answer. No conviction
of duty or feeling of filial regard was strong
enough to overwhelm love in this woman's heart.
As she spoke she flashed upon him her most brilliant
glance and by a deft movement of her bridle hand
swerved the jennet in closer to his barb. She laid
her hand upon his strong arm and bent her head
close toward him. They were far from the others
now and the turns of the winding road concealed
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"A slave to whom? Perhaps to&mdash;me?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"Have mercy on me!" he cried. "To you?
Yes. But honor, duty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Again those hateful words!" she interrupted,
her dark face flushing with anger. "Were I a man,
loved I a woman who loved me as I&mdash;as I&mdash;as one
you know, I would have seized her in spite of all the
world! Once she had fled to the shelter of my arms,
while life beat in my heart none should tear her
thence."</p>

<p>"Thy father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He thinks not of my happiness."</p>

<p>"Say not so, Donna Mercedes."</p>

<p>"'Tis true. It is a matter of convenient arrangement.
Two ancient names, two great fortunes cry
aloud for union and they drown the voice of the
heart. I am bestowed like a chattel."</p>

<p>"Don Felipe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is an honorable gentleman, a brave one. He
needs no defense at my hands. That much, at least,
my father did. There is no objection to my suitor
save that I do not love him."</p>

<p>"In time&mdash;in time you may," gasped Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Dost thou look within thine own heart and see a
fancy so evanescent that thou speakest thus to me?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe thee, and were a thousand years to roll
over my head thine image would still be found
here."</p>

<p>She laid her tiny gloved hand upon her breast as
she spoke in a low voice, and this time she looked
away from him. He would have given heaven and
earth to have caught her yielding figure in his arms.
She drooped in the saddle beside him in a pose which
was a confession of womanly weakness and she
swayed toward him as if the heart in her body cried
out to that which beat in his own breast.</p>

<p>"Mercedes! Mercedes!" he said, "you torture
me beyond endurance! Go back to your duenna, to
Se&ntilde;ora Agapida, I beg of you! I can stand no
more! I did promise and vow in my heart&mdash;my
honor&mdash;my duty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, with men it is different," said the girl, and
the sound of a sob in her voice cut him to the heart,
"and these things are above love, above everything.
I do not&mdash;I can not understand. I can not comprehend.
You have rejected me&mdash;I have offered myself
to you a second time&mdash;after the refusal of last
night. Where is my Spanish pride? Where is my
maidenly modesty? That reserve that should be the
better part of woman is gone. I know not honor&mdash;duty&mdash;I
only know that though you reject me, I am
yours. I, too, am a slave. I love you. Nay, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 214-216]</a></span>can not marry Don Felipe de Tobar. 'Twere to
make a sacrilege of a sacrament."</p>

<span class="caption">Alvarado threw his right arm around her, and with a force

</div>

<p>"Thy father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have done my best to obey him. I can no
more."</p>

<p>"What wilt thou do?"</p>

<p>"This!" cried the girl desperately.</p>

<p>The road at the point they had arrived wound
sharply around the spur of the mountain which rose
above them thousands of feet on one side and fell
abruptly away in a terrific precipice upon the other.
As she spoke she struck her horse again with the
whip. At the same time by a violent wrench on the
bridle rein she turned him swiftly toward the open
cliff. Quick as she had been, however, Alvarado's
own movement was quicker. He struck spur into
his powerful barb and with a single bound was by
her side, in the very nick of time. Her horse's forefeet
were slipping among the loose stones on the
edge. In another second they would both be over.
Alvarado threw his right arm around her and with
a force superhuman dragged her from the saddle, at
the same time forcing his own horse violently backward
with his bridle hand. His instant promptness
had saved her, for the frightened horse she rode,
unable to control himself, plunged down the cliff
and was crushed to death a thousand feet below.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class="center">IN WHICH CAPTAIN ALVARADO IS FORSWORN AND WITH DONNA
MERCEDES IN HIS ARMS BREAKS HIS PLIGHTED WORD</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">
<img src="images/m.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>y God!" cried the young soldier
hoarsely, straining her to his breast,
while endeavoring to calm his nervous
and excited horse. "What would you
have done?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/016.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Why didn't you let
me go?" she asked, struggling
feebly in his arms.
"It would all have been
over then."</p>

<p>"I could not, I love
you."</p>

<p>The words were wrung
from him in spite of himself
by her deadly peril,
by her desperate design which he had only frustrated
by superhuman quickness and strength. He
was pale, shaking, trembling, unnerved, for her.
He scarce knew what he said or did, so little command
had he over himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke those words "I love you," so blissful
for her to hear, she slipped her arm around his
neck. It was not in mortal man to resist under such
circumstances. He forgot everything&mdash;honor, duty,
his word, everything he threw to the winds. Before
the passion which sought death when denied him his
own powers of resistance vanished. He strained her
to his breast and bent his head to kiss her. Again
and again he drank at the upturned fountain of
affection, her lips. The shock had been too much
for him. Greater for him than for her. He had
seen her upon the verge of eternity. She thought
nothing of that in her present joy. She only realized
that she was in his arms again, that he had
kissed her, and between the kisses he poured out
words that were even greater caresses.</p>

<p>The others were far behind. They were alone
upon the mountain-side with the rocks behind and the
great sapphire sea of the Caribbean before them.
He held her close to his breast and they forgot everything
but love as they gently pricked along the road.
It was near noon now, and as the road a furlong
farther debouched into an open plateau shaded by
trees and watered by a running brook which purled
down the mountain-side from some inaccessible cloud-swept
height it was a fitting place to make camp,
where the whole party, tired by a long morning's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
travel, could repose themselves until the breeze of
afternoon tempered the heat of the day. Here he dismounted,
lifted her from horse, and they stood together,
side by side.</p>

<p>"You have saved me," she whispered, "you have
drawn me back from the death that I sought. God
has given me to you. We shall never be parted."</p>

<p>"I am a false friend, an ungrateful servitor, a forsworn
man, a perjured soldier!" he groaned, passing
his hand over his pale brow as if to brush away the
idea consequent upon his words.</p>

<p>"But thou hast my love," she whispered tenderly,
swaying toward him again.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes. Would that it could crown something
else than my dishonor."</p>

<p>"Say not so."</p>

<p>She kissed him again, fain to dispel the shadow
that darkened his face.</p>

<p>"I had been faithful," he went on, as if in justification,
"had I not seen thee on the brink of that cliff,
and then thou wert in my arms&mdash;I was lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I was found. I leaped to death. I shut my
eyes as I drove the horse toward the cliff, and I
awakened to find myself in your arms&mdash;in heaven!
Let nothing take me hence."</p>

<p>"It can not be," he said, "I must go to the Vice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>roy
when he returns from the Orinoco war, and tell
him that I have betrayed him."</p>

<p>"I will tell him," she answered, "or wilt thou tell
him what I tell thee?" she went on.</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"Then say to him that I sought death rather than
be given to Don Felipe or to any one else. Tell him
you saved me on the very brink of the cliff, and that
never soldier made a better fight for field or flag than
thou didst make for thy honor and duty, but that I
broke thee down. I had the power, and I used it.
The story is as old as Eden&mdash;the woman tempted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should have been stronger&mdash;I should not have
weakened. But I shall fight no more&mdash;it is all over."</p>

<p>"Ah, thou canst not," she whispered, nestling
closer to him. "And tell my father that should harm
come to thee, if, in their anger, he or de Tobar lay
hand upon thee, it will not advantage their plans, for
I swear, if there be no other way, I will starve myself
to death to follow thee!"</p>

<p>"I can not shelter myself behind a woman."</p>

<p>"Then I will tell them both myself," she cried.
"You shall know, they shall know, how a Spanish
woman can love."</p>

<p>"And thou shalt know, too," answered Alvarado
firmly, "that though I break my heart, I, an unknown,
can expatiate his guilt with all the pride of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
most ancient lineage and birth highest of them all."</p>

<p>It was a brave speech, but he did not release his
hold upon Mercedes and in spite of his words when,
confident that whatever he might say, however he
might struggle, he was hers at last, she smiled up at
him again, he kissed her.</p>

<p>"When go you to my father, Se&ntilde;or Alvarado?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"When he returns from the Orinoco."</p>

<p>"And that will not be until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps a month."</p>

<p>"Wilt love me until then?"</p>

<p>"I shall love thee forever."</p>

<p>"Nay, but wilt thou tell me so, with every day,
every week, every hour, every moment, with kisses
like to these?"</p>

<p>"Oh, tempt me not!" he whispered; but he returned
again and again her caresses.</p>

<p>"Ah, my Alvarado, if you have once fallen, what
then? Is not one kiss as bad as a thousand?"</p>

<p>"Be it so; we will be happy until that time."</p>

<p>"One month, one month of heaven, my love, after
that let come what may," she answered, her cheeks
and eyes aflame, her heart throbbing with exquisite
pain in her breast. They would enjoy the day, the
future could take care of itself.</p>

<p>"Some one approaches!" he said at last, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the same moment the rest of the party came around
the bend of the road. The poor duenna was consumed
with anxiety and remorse.</p>

<p>"Bernardo," said Alvarado to the sergeant, "we
will take our siesta here. Unsaddle the horses and
prepare the noon-day meal under the trees. Send one
of the troopers ahead to bid Fadrique stop on the road
until we rejoin him, keeping good guard. Se&ntilde;ora
Agapida, you must be tired from the long ride. Let
me assist you to dismount."</p>

<p>"The Se&ntilde;orita Mercedes!" she asked, as he lifted
her to the ground. "Where is her horse?"</p>

<p>"He slipped and fell," answered the girl promptly.</p>

<p>"Fell? Madre de Dios!"</p>

<p>"Yes, over the cliff. Captain Alvarado lifted me
from the saddle just in time."</p>

<p>"I shall make a novena of devotion to St. Jago for
thy preservation, sweet Mercedes," cried the duenna,
"and you, young sir, must have a strong arm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is ever at your service," answered Alvarado
gravely, bowing before her.</p>

<p>The old woman's heart went out to the gallant
young man, so handsome, so brave, so strong, so distinguished
looking.</p>

<p>"Why," she mused under her breath, "could he
not have been the one?"</p>

<p>By this time the little place was filled with soldiers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
attendants, and muleteers. Some kindled fires, others
unpacked hampers loaded with provisions, others prepared
a place where the party might rest, and as, to
restore order out of this confusion, Alvarado turned
hither and thither he was followed in all his movements
by the lovely eyes of the woman who had
broken him, and who had won him.</p>

<p>During the interval of repose the young man
allowed his party the two lovers were constantly together.
Alvarado had made a faint effort to go apart
and leave Mercedes to herself, but with passionate
determination she had refused to allow it. She had
thrown prudence to the winds. Careless of whoever
might see, of whoever might comment, heedless of
the reproving duenna, indifferent to ancient practice,
reckless of curious glances, she had insisted upon
accompanying the captain and he had yielded. He
was doomed in his own soul to death. He intended
to tell the Viceroy and de Tobar everything, and he
had no doubt that one or the other would instantly
kill him. It was a fate to which he would make no
resistance. Meanwhile he would enjoy the day.
There was a melancholy pleasure, too, in the thought,
for this morning had assured him of it, that whatever
awaited him Mercedes would belong to no one else.
If they killed him she had sworn that she would not
survive him. If they strove to force her into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
arms of another, she had declared she would die
rather than comply, and he believed her.</p>

<p>Other women in like circumstances might have
resorted to a convent, but Mercedes was not of the
temperament which makes that calm harbor an inviting
refuge. If she could not have Alvarado, she
would simply die&mdash;that was all. Under the circumstances,
therefore, as he had already forfeited his
own esteem, he hesitated no more. Indeed, before
the passion of the woman he loved, who loved him,
it was not possible. In her presence he could do
nothing else. They abandoned themselves with all
the fervor of youth and passion to their transports of
affection. They wandered away from the others and
by the side of the brook beneath the shelter of the
trees remained together and whispered all the love
that beat within their freed breasts. They might die
to-morrow, to-day they lived and loved. Fain would
they have prolonged the Elysian dream forever, but
the descending sun of the afternoon at last warned
Alvarado, if they would reach La Guayra that night,
that they must resume their journey. Reluctantly he
gave the order to mount.</p>

<p>This time, utterly indifferent to the Se&ntilde;ora Agapida,
Mercedes, mounted on one of the led horses,
rode openly by Alvarado's side. Sustained by his
presence, constantly in touch with him, she made the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
way down the difficult wanderings of the rocky mountain
trail. They watched the sun set in all its glory
over the tropic sea. The evening breeze blew softly
about them riding side by side. Then the night fell
upon them. Over them blazed the glorious canopy of
the tropic stars, chief among them the fiery Southern
Cross, emblem of the faith they cherished, the most
marvelous diadem in the heavens. There below them
twinkled the lights of La Guayra. The road grew
broader and smoother now. It was almost at the level
of the beach. They would have to pass through the
town presently, and thence up a steep rocky road
which wound around the mountain until they surmounted
the cliff back of the city and arrived at the
palace of the Governor upon the hillside, where Mercedes
was to lodge. An hour, at least, would bring
them to their destination now. There was nothing to
apprehend. The brigands in the fastnesses of the
mountains or the savages, who sometimes strayed
along the road, never ventured so near the town.</p>

<p>Fadrique, by Alvarado's orders, had fallen back
nearer the main body so as to be within call.</p>

<p>"We shall be there in a little while. See yonder,
the lights of the town," said the captain.</p>

<p>"While thou art with me," said the girl, "it matters
little where we are. There are but two places in
the world now&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"And those are&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Where thou art and where thou art not. If I
may only be with thee, if we may be together, I want
nothing else."</p>

<p>She had scarcely spoken before the sound of a cry
followed by a shot broke on the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>he terrific impact of the huge ship on the
sand among the breakers which thundered
and beat upon her sides with
overwhelming force came just in the
nick of time for Morgan. Had the disaster been delayed
a second longer the furious buccaneers would
have cut him down where he stood. Even the officers
were angered beyond measure at him for their present
situation, which threatened the loss of the vast
treasure already gained in the ship, although they
had consented to Morgan's proposition to attack La
Guayra and Caracas, and the captain was in no way
responsible for the storm and the wreck which
jeoparded their booty and their future. Therefore
it is probable that none of them, unless it were
Teach, would have interfered to save Morgan, and
he would have been swept from his feet by the
savage men and instantly killed, in spite of all that
he, or Carib, or any one else could have done. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the violence of the shock when the ship took ground
threw them to the deck, and they forgot for the
instant their bloody purpose of vengeance in the
inevitableness of their approaching danger; they
were checked in their mad anger for a few seconds
and given a moment for reflection, that moment convinced
them that they could not yet dispense with
the services of their captain. With black rage and
white fear striving for mastery in their hearts, they
rose to their feet and faced him with menacing faces
and threatening gestures.</p>

<p>"What's to be done now?" questioned one bolder
than the rest.</p>

<p>"Now's the time," roared the undaunted Morgan,
striving to make himself heard by all above the
thundering seas, "to show your courage, lads!"</p>

<p>He had quickly observed that the force with
which she had been driven on the shoals had shoved
the galleon's nose firmly in the sand. She had been
caught just before she took ground by a tremendous
roller and had been lifted up and hurled far over to
starboard. Although almost on her beam ends, her
decks inclining landward, the strongly-built ship
held steady in spite of the tremendous onslaughts of
the seas along her bilge.</p>

<p>"Take heart, men!" he cried. "Observe. She
lies still and secure. 'Tis a stout hulk and will take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
a tremendous battering before she breaks. We may
yet save ourselves."</p>

<p>"And the treasure?" roared one.</p>

<p>"Ay, and the treasure."</p>

<p>"I think the storm has about blown itself out,"
interposed old Hornigold, shouting out at this instant.
"Look you, mates," he cried, pointing to
westward, "it clears! The sun'll set fair to-night."</p>

<p>"The bo's'n is right," cried Morgan. "But first
of all we must take no chances with our lives. Even
though we lose the ship we can seize another. The
world is full of treasure and we can find it. Now I
want some one to carry a line ashore through the
breakers. Who will volunteer?"</p>

<p>"I," said Carib instantly.</p>

<p>"I need you here," answered Morgan, who did
not purpose to be deprived of that bodyguard upon
whose watchfulness his life had so often depended.</p>

<p>"I'll go," exclaimed young Teach, breaking
through the crowd.</p>

<p>"That's a brave heart!" said Morgan. "A line
here!"</p>

<p>Instantly a light line was forthcoming. Teach
tore off his jacket, laid aside his weapons, kicked off
his shoes, took a turn of the line around his waist,
made it fast, wrung Morgan's hand, watched his
chance, leaped overboard, was caught by an on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>rushing
wave and carried far toward the shore. The
ebb of the roller carried him back seaward some distance,
but he swam forward madly, and the next
wave brought him a little nearer the beach. He
was driven backward and forward, but each time
managed to get a little nearer the shore line.</p>

<p>The whole ship's company stared after him, spontaneously
cheering and yelling cries of encouragement
in spite of the fact that he could not hear a
single sound in the roaring, raging seas. Morgan
himself tended the line, skilfully paying it out when
necessary. In a few moments, although the time
seemed hours to the watchers, the feet of Teach
touched the shore, and although the terrific undertow
of the wave that had dropped him there almost
bore him back again, yet by a superhuman exertion
he managed to stagger forward, and the next
moment they saw him fall prostrate on the sand.</p>

<p>Had he fainted or given way? They looked at
him with bated breath but after a little space they
saw him rise slowly to his feet and stagger inland
toward a low point where a lofty palm tree was
writhing and twisting in the fierce wind. He was
too good a seaman not instantly to see what was
required of him, for, waving his hand toward the
ship he at once began to haul in the line. Ready
hands had bent a larger rope to it, which was suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ceeded
by a third, strong enough to bear a man's
weight. The buccaneer hauled this last in with
great difficulty, for the distance was far and the wet
rope was heavy. He climbed up and made it fast
to the tree and then waited. As soon as he had done
so there was a rush on the ship for the line which
had been made fast inboard temporarily. Morgan,
however, interposed between the crew and the
coveted way to safety.</p>

<p>"Back!" he shouted. "One at a time, and the
order as I appoint! You, L'Ollonois, and you, and
you," he cried, indicating certain men upon whom
he could depend. "Go in succession. Then haul a
heavier rope ashore. We'll put a traveler with a
bo's'n's chair on it, and send these nuns and the
priests first of all."</p>

<p>"Do we have to wait for a lot of wimmin and
papists?" growled one man among the frightened
rascals.</p>

<p>"You have to wait until the ship breaks up beneath
your feet, if it is my pleasure," said Morgan,
coolly, and they slunk back again, cowed. He was
master of the situation once more.</p>

<p>There was something about that man that enforced
obedience, whether they would or no. His
orders were promptly obeyed and intelligently
carried out by L'Ollonois and his men, who first went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
ashore. A heavy hawser was dragged through the
surf and made fast high up on the sturdy palm tree.
On it they rigged a traveler and the chair, and then
the frightened nuns were brought forward from the
cabin.</p>

<p>The women were sick with apprehension. They
knew, of course, that the ship had struck, and they
had been expecting instant death. Their prayers
had been rudely interrupted by Morgan's messenger,
and when they came out on deck in that stern tempest,
amid that body of wild, ruthless men, their
hearts sank within them. At the sight of those
human fiends they would fain have welcomed that
watery grave from which they had just been imploring
God to save them. When they discovered that
their only means of safety lay in making that perilous
passage through the waters which overwhelmed
the bight of rope in which hung the boatswain's
chair, they counted themselves as dead. Indeed,
they would have refused to go had it not been for
the calm and heroic resolution of the abbess, their
leader, Sister Maria Christina, who strove to assuage
their fears.</p>

<p>"Hornigold," said Morgan, "are you still faithful
to me in this crisis?"</p>

<p>"I shall obey you in all things&mdash;now," answered
the boatswain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Swear it."</p>

<p>"By the old buccaneer faith," said the One-Eyed,
again adding the significant adverb, "now."</p>

<p>For a wonder, the captain paid no attention to the
emphasis on the word, "now."</p>

<p>"Can you keep your pistols dry?"</p>

<p>"I can wrap them in oilskin and thrust them in
my jacket."</p>

<p>"Go to the shore, then," said Morgan, "and receive
these women. March them away from the
men to yonder clump of palms, and guard them as
you would your life. If any man approach you or
them for any purpose, shoot him dead without a
word. I'll see that the others have no weapons.
D'ye understand?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and shall obey."</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>The boatswain swung himself into the chair and
the men on the other end of the traveler pulled him
to the other shore, none the worse for his wetting.
He opened his jacket, found the weapons dry, and
waved his hand as a sign to Morgan that he was all
right.</p>

<p>"Which of you women will go first?" asked Morgan.</p>

<p>He turned instinctively to the tall abbess, towering
among her shrinking sisters. She indicated first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
one and then another among the poor captives, and
as they refused, she turned to Morgan and, with a
grave dignity, said in Spanish, of which he was a
master, that she would go first to show the way, and
then the others would be in better heart to follow.
She sat down on the boatswain's chair&mdash;which, was
simply a bit of wood held like the seat of a swing in
a triangle of rope&mdash;made the sign of the cross, and
waved her hand. She was hauled ashore in an instant
with nothing worse to complain of than a
drenching by the waves. By Hornigold's direction
she walked past him toward the clump of palms
which Morgan had indicated.</p>

<p>One after another of the women were sent forward
until the whole party was ashore. Then the
Spanish priests took their turn, and after these
reached the sand the rest of the crew were sent
ashore. Morgan was careful to indicate each one's
turn, so that he preserved a balance between the
more reputable and the more degraded members of
the crew, both on ship and shore. Among the last
to go were the maroon and de Lussan, each armed as
Hornigold had been. They had both received instructions,
one to station himself at the palm tree,
the other to cover the hawser where it ran along the
shore before it entered the water. These precautionary
orders which he had given were necessary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
for when the last man had been hauled ashore and
Morgan stepped into the chair for his turn, one of
the infuriated buccaneers, watching his chance,
seized his jack-knife, the only weapon that he had,
for Morgan had been careful to make the men leave
their arms on the ship, and made a rush for the
rope to cut it and leave the captain to his fate. But
de Lussan shot him dead, and before the others could
make a move Morgan stepped safely on the sand.</p>

<p>"That was well done," he cried, turning to the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Ah, mon capitaine," answered the other, "it
was not from affection, but because you are necessary
to us."</p>

<p>"Whatever it may be," returned the old man, "I
owe much to you and scuttle me, I'll not forget it."</p>

<p>The Frenchman, indifferent to Morgan's expressions
of gratitude, shrugged his shoulders, turned
away, and made no reply.</p>

<p>The transportation of so many people across the
slender line had taken a long time. The sun, just
beginning to break through the riven clouds, was
near its setting; night would soon be upon them.
They must hurry with what was yet to be done.
Morgan sent Teach and the Brazilian back to the
ship with instructions to gather up enough weapons
to arm the crew and to send them ashore. This was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
promptly done. Indeed, communication was not
difficult now that the force of the gale was abating.
The ship had been badly battered but still held together,
and would hold unless the storm came up
again. As the arms came ashore Morgan served
them out to those men whom he considered most
reliable; and, after throwing out a strong guard
around the band, the rest sought shelter around
huge driftwood fires which had been kindled by the
use of flint and steel. There was hardly a possibility
they would be observed in that deserted land, but
still it was wise to take precaution.</p>

<p>Morgan ordered the women and priests to be
double-guarded by the trustiest, and it was well that
he did so. He gave old Hornigold particular charge
of them. The buccaneers were hungry and thirsty,
but they were forced to do without everything until
morning when they could get all they wanted from
the ship. So they tightened their belts and disposed
themselves about the fires as best they could to get
what rest they might.</p>

<span class="caption">But de Lussan shot him dead, and before the others could make

</div>

<p>Morgan and the officers drew apart and consulted
long and earnestly over the situation. They could
never make the ship seaworthy again. To build a
smaller one out of her timbers would be the work of
months and when it was finished it could not possibly
carry the whole crew. To march westward toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 240-242]</a></span>
the Isthmus meant to encounter terrific hardships
for days; their presence would speedily become
known, and they would be constantly menaced or
attacked by troops from the heavily garrisoned
places like Porto Bello and Carthagena. Back of
them a short distance away lay La Guayra. It could
be taken by surprise, Morgan urged, and easily captured.
If they started to march westward the Indians
would apprise the Spaniards of their presence,
and they would have to fight their way to the Pacific.
If they took La Guayra, then the Viceroy, with the
treasure of his palace and the opulent city of Caracas
would be at their mercy. They could ravage
the two towns, seize the first ship that came to the
roadstead, and make their way to the Isthmus safely
and speedily. As to the treasure on the galleon,
the buccaneer captain proposed to unload it and bury
it in the sand, and after they had captured La
Guayra it would be easy to get it back again.</p>

<p>Morgan's counsel prevailed, and his was the resolution
to which they came. The council of war broke
up thereafter, and those not told off to watch with
the guards went to sleep near the fires. Morgan,
under the guardianship of the faithful Black Dog,
threw himself upon the ground to catch a few hours'
rest.</p>

<p>The next morning the wind had died away and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
sea was fairly calm. The men swam out to the galleon,
found her still intact though badly strained,
and by means of boats and rafts, working with
persistent energy, succeeded in landing and burying
the treasure under the very palm tree which held the
rope that had given them salvation.</p>

<p>Morgan's plan was an excellent one, the best that
could be suggested in the straits they then were, and
it received the hearty assent of all the men. It
took them all day to land the treasure and make
their other preparations, which included the manufacture
of several rude scaling ladders, pieces of
timber with cross pieces nailed upon them, which
could be used in surmounting the walls of the town.
In the evening the order of march was arranged
and their departure set for the morrow. They had
saved their treasure, they had food in plenty now,
and with dry clothes and much rum they began to
take a more cheerful view of life. They were fairly
content once more.</p>

<p>The next day, in the afternoon, for he desired to
approach the town at nightfall, Morgan gave the
order to advance. He was as much of a soldier as
a sailor and sent ahead a party of choice spirits
under Teach, while the main body followed some
distance behind. As the shades of evening descended
a messenger from the advance guard came back with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the news that a party of travelers had been seen
coming down the mountain; that they comprised a
half-dozen troopers, a number of slaves, a heavily
laden pack train, and two women.</p>

<p>Teach had stationed his men under the trees at a
bend of the road around which the travelers had to
pass, and he awaited Morgan's orders. Taking a
detachment of the most reliable men with Velsers
and Hornigold, and bidding the other officers and
men to stand where they were until he sent word,
Morgan and those with him ran rapidly forward
until they came to the ambuscade which young
Teach had artfully prepared. He and his had
scarcely time to dispose themselves for concealment
before a soldier came riding carelessly down the
road. Waiting until the man had passed him a
short distance and until the other unsuspicious
travelers were fairly abreast the liers-in-wait, whom
he had charged on no account to move until he gave
the word, Morgan stepped out into the open and
called. The buccaneers instantly followed him.</p>

<p>As the soldier saw these fierce looking men spring
before him out of the darkness, he cried aloud. The
next moment he was shot dead by Morgan himself.
At the same instant a volley rang out at contact
range, and every man in the party fell to the ground.
Some were killed, others only wounded; all of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
except Alvarado were injured in some way. He
struck spurs into his horse when he heard the cry
of Fadrique and the shot. The surprised barb
plunged forward, was hit by half a dozen bullets,
fell to the ground in a heap, and threw his rider over
his head. The Spaniard scrambled to his feet,
whipped out his sword, lunged forward and drove
his blade into the breast of old Velsers. The next
instant a dozen weapons flashed over his head. One
rang upon his steel casque, another crashed against
the polished breastplate that he wore. He cut out
again in the darkness, and once more fleshed his
weapon.</p>

<p>Women's screams rose above the tumult. Beating
back the swords which menaced him, although
he was reeling from the blows which he had received,
Alvarado strove to make his way toward Donna Mercedes,
when he was seized in the darkness from behind.</p>

<p>"Kill him!" cried a voice in English, which Alvarado
and Mercedes both understood perfectly.
"He's the only one alive."</p>

<p>"Nay," cried another voice, stronger and sterner,
"save him; we'll question him later. Did any
escape?"</p>

<p>"Not one."</p>

<p>"Are there any horses alive?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two or three."</p>

<p>"Bring them hither. Now back to the rest. Then
we can show a light and see what we have captured.
Teach, lead on. Let no harm come to the women."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," answered another voice out of the
darkness, and a third voice growled out:</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better make sure that none are alive
to tell the tale?"</p>

<p>"Of course; a knife for the wounded," answered
the stern voice, "and bear a hand."</p>

<p>Greatly surprised and unable to comprehend anything
but that his men had been slaughtered and no
harm had as yet befallen his charges, Alvarado,
whose arms had been bound to his side, found himself
dragged along in the wake of his captors, one or
two of whom mounted on the unwounded horses,
with the two women between them, rode rapidly
down the road.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TELLS HOW MERCEDES DE LARA RETURNED THE UNSOUGHT
CARESS OF SIR HENRY MORGAN, AND THE MEANS BY
WHICH THE BUCCANEERS SURMOUNTED THE WALLS</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">

</div>

<p>ne hundred yards or so beyond the place
of the ambush the road dropped sharply
over the last low cliff to the narrow
strand which led to the west wall of La
Guayra, distant a half a mile away. They had all
been under the deep shadow of the thick trees overhanging
the way until this instant, but in the faint
light cast by the moon just risen, Alvarado could see
that a great body of people were congregated before
him on the road. Who they were and what they
were he could not surmise. He was not long left in
doubt, however, for the same voice whose commanding
tones had caused his life to be spared, now called
for lights. The demand was obeyed with a promptness
that bespoke fear indeed, or discipline of the
sternest, and soon the captives found themselves in
a circle of lurid light sent forth by a number of blazing
torches.</p>

<p>The illumination revealed to Alvarado as villainous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
and terrible-looking a body of men as he had ever
seen. The first glance convinced him that they were
not Spanish brigands or robbers. He was too young
to have had dealings with the buccaneers of the past
generation, but he realized that if any such remained
on this side of the earth, they must be like these men
who surrounded him. He wasted no time in surmises,
however, for after the first swift comprehensive
glance his eyes sought Mercedes. She sat her
horse free and uninjured apparently, for which he
thanked God. She was leaning forward over her
saddle and staring in bewilderment and surprise at
the scene and confusion before her.</p>

<p>"Donna Mercedes," cried Alvarado, turning himself
about, in spite of his bonds and the restraint his
immediate captors endeavored to put upon him, "are
you safe&mdash;unhurt?"</p>

<p>"Safe," answered the girl, "and thou?"</p>

<p>"Well, but for these bonds."</p>

<p>"God be thanked! Who are these men?"</p>

<p>"I know not, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," interrupted Se&ntilde;ora Agapida, recovering
her voice at the sound of the Spanish tongue, "for
Christ's sake, what does this mean? Save us!"</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ora," said that same sharp voice, but this time
speaking in the Spanish tongue, as a tall man, hat in
hand, urged his horse forward, "fear nothing, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
shall be protected. And you, se&ntilde;orita. Do I not
have the honor of addressing Donna Mercedes de
Lara?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," answered the girl, haughtily.
"Who are you? Why have you shot my people and
seized me prisoner?"</p>

<p>"For love of you, Mistress Mercedes."</p>

<p>"Just heaven! Who are you, I say!" cried the
girl at this startling answer, turning in surprise and
terror to look upon his countenance.</p>

<p>There was something familiar in the man's face
that called up a vague recollection which she strove
to master.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she cried again.</p>

<p>"Sir Harry Morgan!" answered the horseman,
bowing low over the saddle, "a free sailor at your
service, ma'am."</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Alvarado, who had listened attentively,
"the buccaneer?"</p>

<p>"The same," answered Morgan turning to him.</p>

<p>"Sir Harry Morgan! Were you not Governor of
Jamaica last year?" asked Mercedes in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I had that honor, lady."</p>

<p>"Why are you now in arms against us?"</p>

<p>"A new king, Mistress de Lara, sits the English
throne. He likes me not. I and these gallant sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>men
are going to establish a kingdom in some sweet
island in the South Seas, with our good swords. I
would fain have a woman to bear me company on
the throne. Since I saw you in Jamaica last year, I
have designed you for the honor&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monster!" screamed the girl, appalled by the
hideous leer which accompanied his words. "Rather
anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sir," interrupted Alvarado, "you are an Englishman.
Your past rank should warrant you a
gentleman, but for this. There is no war between
England and Spain. What is the meaning of this
outrage? This lady is the daughter of the Viceroy
of Venezuela. I am his captain and the commandante
of yonder city of La Guayra. You have waylaid
us, taken us at a disadvantage. My men are
killed. For this assault His Excellency will exact
bloody reparation. Meanwhile give order that we
be unbound, and let us pass."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the buccaneer. "Think you
I fear the Viceroy? Nay, not His Majesty of Spain
himself! I came here with set purpose to take La
Guayra and then Caracas, and to bear away with me
this pretty lady upon whom, I repeat, I design to
bestow the honor of my name."</p>

<p>As he spoke he leaned toward Mercedes, threw
his arm around her waist, and before she was even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
aware of her intention, kissed her roughly on the
cheek.</p>

<p>"Lads," he cried, "three cheers for the future
Lady Morgan!"</p>

<p>The proud Spanish girl turned white as death
under this insult. Her eyes flashed like coals of fire.
Morgan was close beside her. She was without
weapon save a jeweled whip that hung at her wrist.
Before the first note of a cheer could break from the
lips of the men she lifted it and struck him violently
again and again full in the face.</p>

<p>"Thou devil!" cried the captain in fury, whipping
out his sword and menacing her with it.</p>

<p>"Strike!" cried Mercedes bravely, "and let my
blood wash out the insult that you have put upon my
cheek."</p>

<p>She raised her whip once more, but this time
young Teach, coming on the other side, caught her
hand, wrested the jeweled toy from her, and broke
it in the struggle.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt pay dearly for those stripes, lady!"
roared Morgan, swerving closer to her. "And not
now in honorable wedlock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will die first!" returned Mercedes.</p>

<p>Alvarado, meanwhile, had been struggling
desperately to free himself. By the exercise of
superhuman strength, just as Morgan again menaced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
the woman he loved, he succeeded in freeing himself
from his loosely-tied bonds. His guards for the
moment had their attention distracted from him by
the group on horseback. He wrenched a sword from
the hand of one, striking him a blow with his naked
fist that sent him reeling as he did so, and then flung
out his other arm so that the heavy pommel of the
sword struck the second guard in the face, and the
way was clear for the moment. He sprang forward
instantly, seized Morgan's horse, forced him away
from Mercedes by a wrench of his powerful arm,
and stood at bay in front of the woman he loved.
He said no word but stood with his sword up on
guard, panting heavily from his fierce exertions.</p>

<p>"Alvarado, you will be killed!" screamed the
girl, seeing the others make for him.</p>

<p>"Here we have it," sneered Morgan. "This is
the secret of your refusal. He is your lover."</p>

<p>"Seize him!" cried Teach, raising his sword, as
followed by the others he made at Alvarado, who
awaited them undaunted.</p>

<p>"Stay!" shouted de Lussan, "there is a better
way."</p>

<p>Rudely shoving Se&ntilde;ora Agapida aside, he seized
Mercedes from behind.</p>

<p>"Do not move, mademoiselle," he said in French,
in his excitement, which fortunately she understood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's well done!" cried Morgan, "Captain Alvarado,
if that be your name, throw down your
sword if you would save the lady's life."</p>

<p>"Mind me not, Alvarado," cried Mercedes, but
Alvarado, perceiving the situation, instantly dropped
his weapon.</p>

<p>"Now seize him and bind him again! And you,
dogs!" Morgan added, turning to the men who had
allowed the prisoner to slip before, "if he escape
you again you shall be hanged to the nearest tree!"</p>

<p>"Hadst not better bind the woman, too?" queried
the Frenchman gently, still holding her fast in his
fierce grasp.</p>

<p>"Ay, the wench as well. Oh, I'll break your
spirit, my pretty one," answered Morgan savagely,
flipping the young woman's cheek. "Wilt pay me
blows for kisses? Scuttle me, you shall crawl at my
feet before I've finished with you!"</p>

<p>"Why not kill this caballero out of hand, captain?"
asked Hornigold, savage from a slight
wound, as he limped up to Morgan.</p>

<p>"No, I have use for him. Are the rest silent?"</p>

<p>"They will tell no tales," laughed L'Ollonois
grimly.</p>

<p>"Did none escape back up the road?"</p>

<p>"None, Sir Henry," answered the other. "My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
men closed in after them and drove them forward.
They are all gone."</p>

<p>"That's well. Now, for La Guayra. What force
is there, Se&ntilde;or Capitan?"</p>

<p>Alvarado remained obstinately silent. He did not
speak even when Morgan ruthlessly cut him across
the cheek with his dagger. He did not utter a sound,
although Mercedes groaned in anguish at the sight of
his torture.</p>

<p>"You'd best kill him, captain," said L'Ollonois.</p>

<p>"No, I have need for him, I say," answered Morgan,
giving over the attempt to make him speak.
"Is any one here who has been at La Guayra
recently?" he asked of the others.</p>

<p>"I was there last year on a trading ship of
France," answered Sawkins.</p>

<p>"What garrison then?"</p>

<p>"About two hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>"Was it well fortified?"</p>

<p>"As of old, sir, by the forts on either side and a
rampart along the sea wall."</p>

<p>"Were the forts in good repair?"</p>

<p>"Well kept indeed, but most of the guns bore
seaward."</p>

<p>"Have you the ladders ready?" cried Morgan to
Braziliano, who had been charged to convey the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
rude scaling ladders by which they hoped to get over
the walls.</p>

<p>"All ready, captain," answered that worthy.</p>

<p>"Let us go forward then. We'll halt just out of
musket-shot and concert our further plans. We
have the Governor in our hands, lads. The rest will
be easy. There is plenty of plunder in La Guayra,
and when we have made it our own we'll over the
mountains and into Caracas. Hornigold, you are
lame from a wound, look to the prisoners."</p>

<p>"To La Guayra! To La Guayra!" enthusiastically
shouted the men, taking up the line of march.</p>

<p>The rising moon flooding the white strand made
the scene as light as day. They kept good watch on
the walls of La Guayra, for the sound of the shots in
the night air had been heard by some keen-eared
sentry, and as a result the garrison had been called
to arms. The firing had been too heavy to be
accounted for by any ordinary circumstances, and
officers and soldiers had been at a loss to understand
it. However, to take precautions were wise, and
every preparation was made as if against an immediate
attack. The drums were beaten; the ramparts
were manned; the guns were primed, and such
of the townspeople as were not too timid to bear
arms were assembled under their militia officers.</p>

<p>The watchers on the west wall of the fort were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
soon aware of the approach of the buccaneers. Indeed,
they made no concealment whatever about
their motions. Who they were and what they were
the garrison had not discovered and could not
imagine. A prompt and well-aimed volley, however,
as soon as the buccaneers came within range apprised
them that they were dealing with enemies,
and determined enemies at that. Under cover of
the confusion caused by this unexpected discharge,
Morgan deployed his men.</p>

<p>"Lads," he said, "we'll board yon fort with a
rush and a cheer. The ladders will be placed on
the walls, and under cover of a heavy fire from our
musketry we'll go over them. Use only the cutlass
when you gain the parapet and ply like men. Remember
what's on the other side!"</p>

<p>"Ay, but who'll plant the ladders?" asked one.</p>

<p>"The priests and women," said Morgan grimly.
"I saved them for that."</p>

<p>A roar of laughter and cheers broke from the
ruffianly gang as they appreciated the neatness of
the old buccaneer's scheme.</p>

<p>"'Tis an old trick," he continued; "we did the
same thing thirty years since at Porto Bello. Eh,
Hornigold? How's that leg of yours?"</p>

<p>"Stiff and sore."</p>

<p>"Bide here then with the musketeers. Teach,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
you shall take the walls under the cliff yonder.
L'Ollonois, lead your men straight at the fort. De
Lussan, let the curtain between be your point. I
shall be with the first to get over. Now, charge
your pieces all, and Hornigold, after we have started,
by slow and careful fire do you keep the Spaniards
down until you hear us cheer. After that, hold
your fire."</p>

<p>"But I should like to be in the first rank myself,
master," growled the old boatswain.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Morgan, "that's a right
spirit, lad, but that cut leg holds you back, for
which you have to thank this gentleman," bowing
toward Alvarado with a hideous countenance. "You
can be of service here. Watch the musketeers. We
would have no firing into our backs. Now bring
up the women and priests. And, Hornigold, watch
Se&ntilde;orita de Lara. See that she does not escape. On
your life, man; I'd rather hold her safe," he muttered
under his breath, "than take the whole city
of Caracas."</p>

<p>With shouts of fiendish glee the buccaneers drove
the hapless nuns and priests, who had been dragged
along in the rear, to the front. The Spaniards were
firing at them now, but with no effect so far. The
distance was great and the moonlight made aim uncertain,
and every time a head showed itself over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the battlement it became a target for the fire of the
musketeers, who, by Hornigold's orders, ran forward
under the black shadow cast by the high cliff,
where they could not be seen, and from this point of
concealment, taking deliberate aim, made havoc
among the defenders.</p>

<p>"Now, good fathers and sisters," began Morgan,
"you have doubtless been curious to know why you
were not put to death. I saved you&mdash;not because I
loved you, but because I needed you. I had a purpose
in view; that purpose is now apparent."</p>

<p>"What would you with us, se&ntilde;or?" asked Sister
Maria Christina, the abbess, stepping out in front of
her sisters.</p>

<p>"A little service, my sister. Bring up the ladders,
men. See, there are seven all told. That will
be four ladies apiece to four ladders; and here are
seven priests, which allows two to each of the three
remaining ladders, with one priest and one sister
over for good measure, and to take the place of any
that may be struck down."</p>

<p>"And what are we to do with them, se&ntilde;or?"
asked Fra Antonio de Las Casas, drawing nearer to
the captain.</p>

<p>"You are to carry them to yonder wall and place
them against it."</p>

<p>"You do not mean," burst out Alvarado pain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>fully,
for he could scarcely speak from his wounded
cheek, "to make these holy women bear the brunt
of that fire from the fort, and the good priests as
well?"</p>

<p>"Do I value the lives of women and priests, accursed
Spaniard, more than our own?" questioned
the captain, and the congenial sentiment was received
by a yell of approval from the men. "But
if you are tender-hearted, I'll give the defenders a
chance. Will you advise them to yield and thus
spare these women?"</p>

<p>"I can not do that," answered Alvarado sadly.
"'Tis their duty to defend the town. There are
twenty women here, there are five hundred there."</p>

<p>"D'ye hear that, mates?" cried Morgan. "Up
with the ladders!"</p>

<p>"But what if we refuse?" cried the abbess.</p>

<p>"You shall be given over to the men," answered
Morgan, ferociously, "whereas, if you do as I order,
you may go free; those who are left alive after the
storm. Do ye hear, men? We'll let them go after
they have served us," continued the chief turning to
his men. "Swear that you will let them go! There
are others in La Guayra."</p>

<p>"We swear, we swear!" shouted one after another,
lifting their hands and brandishing their
weapons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"You hear!" cried Morgan. "Pick up the
ladders!"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, sir&mdash;&mdash;" began Maria Christina.</p>

<p>"I know no God," interrupted Morgan.</p>

<p>"You had a mother&mdash;a wife once&mdash;perhaps children,
Se&ntilde;or Capitan. Unsay your words! We can
not place the ladders which will give you access to
yonder helpless town."</p>

<p>"Then to the men you go!" cried Morgan ruthlessly.
"Forward here, two or three of you, take
this woman! She chooses&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Death&mdash;&mdash;" cried the abbess, snatching a dagger
from the nearest hand and driving it into her breast,
"rather than dishonor!"</p>

<p>She held herself proudly erect for a moment,
swayed back and forth, and then fell prostrate upon
the sand, the blood staining her white robe about the
hilt of the poniard. She writhed and shuddered in
agony where she lay, striving to say something. Fra
Antonio sprang to her side, and before any one
could interfere knelt down.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I have sinned," she gasped. "Mercy,
mercy!"</p>

<p>"Thou hast done well, I absolve thee!" cried the
priest, making the sign of the cross upon her forehead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Death and fury!" shouted Morgan, livid with
rage. "Let her die unshriven! Shall I be balked
thus?"</p>

<p>He sprang toward the old man stooping over the
woman, and struck him across his shaven crown with
the blade of his sword. The priest pitched down instantly
upon the body of the abbess, a long shudder
running through him. Then he lay still.</p>

<p>"Harry Morgan's way!" cried the buccaneer,
recovering his blade. "And you?" turning toward
the other women. "Have you had lesson enough?
Pick up those ladders, or by hell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mercy, mercy!" screamed the frightened nuns.</p>

<p>"Not another word! Drive them forward,
men!"</p>

<p>The buccaneers sprang at the terrified women and
priests, some with weapons out, others with leers
and outstretched arms. First one and then another
gave way. The only leadership among the sisters
and priests lay upon the sand there. What could
they do? They picked up the ladders and, urged
forward by threats and shouts of the buccaneers
under cover of a furious discharge from Hornigold's
musketeers, they ran to the walls imploring the
Spaniards not to fire upon them.</p>

<p>When the Spanish commander perceived who
were approaching, with a mistaken impulse of mercy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
he ordered his men to fire over their heads, and so
did little danger to the approaching buccaneers. A
few of them fell, but the rest dashed into the smoke.
There was no time for another discharge. The ladders
were placed against the walls, and priests and
nuns were ruthlessly cast aside and trampled down.
In a little space the marauders were upon the ramparts
fighting like demons. Morgan, covered by
Black Dog, with Teach, de Lussan, and L'Ollonois,
was in the lead. Truth to tell, the captain was never
backward when fighting was going on. The desperate
onslaught of their overwhelming numbers, once
they had gained a foothold, swept the defenders before
them like chaff. Waiting for nothing, they
sprang down from the fort and raced madly through
the narrow streets of the town. They brushed opposition
away as leaves are driven aside by a
winter storm. Ere the defenders on the east forts
could realize their presence, they were upon them,
also.</p>

<p>In half an hour every man bearing a weapon had
been cut down. The town was at the mercy of this
horde of human tigers. They broke open wine cellars;
they pillaged the provision shops; they tortured
without mercy the merchants and inhabitants to
force them to discover their treasures, and they insulted
and outraged the helpless women. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
completely beyond control now; drunk with
slaughter, intoxicated with liquor, mad with lust,
they ravaged and plundered. To add to the confusion,
fire burst forth here and there, and before
the morning dawned half of the city was in ashes.</p>

<p>The pale moon looked down upon a scene of
horror such as it had never before shone upon, even
in the palmiest days of the buccaneers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p class="center">IN WHICH BENJAMIN HORNIGOLD RECOGNIZES A CROSS, AND
CAPTAIN ALVARADO FINDS AND LOSES A MOTHER ON
THE STRAND</p>

</div>

<p>he musketeers under Hornigold, chosen
for their mastery with the weapon, had
played their parts with cunning skill.</p>

<p>Concealed from observation by the deep
shadow of the cliffs, and
therefore immune from
the enemy's fire, they
had made targets of the
Spaniards on the walls,
and by a close, rapid, and
well-directed discharge,
had kept down the return
of the garrison until
the very moment of the
assault. Hornigold was
able to keep them in hand for a little space after the
capture of the town, but the thought of the pleasure
being enjoyed by their comrades was too much for
them. Anxious to take a hand in the hideous fray,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
they stole away one by one, slinking under the cliff
until they were beyond the reach of the boatswain,
then boldly rushing for the town in the open, until
the old sailor was left with only a half-dozen of the
most dependable surrounding himself and prisoners.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/019.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The rest would not have got away from him so
easily had he not been so intensely occupied that at
first he had taken little note of what was going on.</p>

<p>Mercedes and Alvarado had only opportunity to
exchange a word now and then, for extended conversation
was prevented by the guards. Alvarado
strove to cheer the woman he loved, and she promised
him she would choose instant death rather than
dishonor. He could give her little encouragement of
rescue, for unless word of their plight were carried
to the Viceroy immediately, he would be far on the
way to the Orinoco country before any tidings could
reach him, and by the time he returned it would be
too late.</p>

<p>Again and again Alvarado strove to break his
bonds, in impotent and helpless fury, but this time
he was securely bound and his captors only laughed
at his struggles. In the midst of their grief and
despair they both took notice of the poor abbess.
Fra Antonio had not moved since Morgan had
stricken him down, but there was life still in the
woman, for, from where they stood, some distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
back, the two lovers each marked her convulsive
trembling. The sight appealed profoundly to them
in spite of their perilous situation.</p>

<p>"The brave sister lives," whispered Mercedes.</p>

<p>"'Tis so," answered Alvarado. "Se&ntilde;or," he
called, "the sister yonder is alive. Wilt not allow us
to minister to her?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Hornigold brusquely, "I will go myself.
Back, all of ye!" he added. "She may wish
to confess to me in default of the worthy father."</p>

<p>He leered hideously as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Coward!" cried Alvarado, but his words affected
Hornigold not at all.</p>

<p>Before he could say another word the guards
forced him rudely back with the two women. The
worthy Se&ntilde;ora Agapida by this time was in a state of
complete and total collapse, but Mercedes bore herself&mdash;her
lover marked with pleasure&mdash;as proudly
and as resolutely as if she still stood within her
father's palace surrounded by men who loved her
and who would die for her.</p>

<p>Rolling the body of the prostrate old man aside,
Hornigold knelt down on the white sand by the form
of the sister. The moonlight shone full upon her
face, and as he stooped over he scanned it with his
one eye. A sudden flash of recognition came to him.
With a muttered oath of surprise he looked again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"It can't be!" he exclaimed, "and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>After Fra Antonio's brave attempt at absolution,
the woman had fainted. Now she opened her eyes,
although she was not yet fully conscious.</p>

<p>"Water!" she gasped feebly, and as it chanced
the boatswain had a small bottle of the precious fluid
hanging from a strap over his shoulder. There was
no pity in the heart of the pirate, he would have allowed
the woman to die gasping for water without
giving her a second thought, but when he recognized
her&mdash;or thought he did&mdash;there instantly sprang into
his mind a desire to make sure. If she were the person
he thought her she might have information of
value. Unslinging the bottle and pulling out the
cork, he placed it to her lips.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;die," she murmured in a stronger voice. "A
priest."</p>

<p>"There is none here," answered the boatswain.
"Fra Antonio&mdash;he absolved you."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Dead, yonder."</p>

<p>"But I must confess."</p>

<p>"Confess to me," chuckled the old man in ghastly
mockery. "Many a woman has done so and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Art in Holy Orders, se&ntilde;or?" muttered the
woman.</p>

<span class="caption">The moonlight shone full upon her face, and as he stooped

</div>

<p>"Holy enough for you. Say on."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 268-270]</a></span></p>
<p>"Fra Antonio, now," she continued, vacantly
lapsing into semi-delirium, "he married us&mdash;'twas a
secret&mdash;his rank was so great. He was rich, I poor&mdash;humble.
The marriage lines&mdash;in the cross. There
was a&mdash;What's that? A shot? The buccaneers.
They are coming! Go not, Francisco!"</p>

<p>Hornigold, bending an attentive ear to these
broken sentences lost not a word.</p>

<p>"Go not," she whispered, striving to lift an arm,
"they will kill thee! Thou shalt not leave me alone,
my Francisco&mdash;The boy&mdash;in Panama&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was evident to the sailor that the poor woman's
mind had gone back to the dreadful days of the sack
of Panama. He was right then, it was she.</p>

<p>"The boy&mdash;save him, save him!" she cried suddenly
with astonishing vigor. The sound of her own
voice seemed to recall her to herself. She stopped,
her eyes lost their wild glare and fixed themselves
upon the man above her, his own face in the shadow
as hers was in the light.</p>

<p>"Is it Panama?" she asked. "Those screams&mdash;the
shots&mdash;" She turned her head toward the city.
"The flames&mdash;is it Panama?"</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the one-eyed fiercely. "'Tis
twenty-five years since then, and more. Yonder city
is La Guayra. This is the coast of Venezuela."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the doomed town&mdash;I remember&mdash;now&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
stabbed myself rather than&mdash;place the ladders. Who
art thou, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"Benjamin Hornigold!" cried the man fiercely,
bending his face to hers.</p>

<p>For a second the woman stared at him. Then,
recognizing him, she screamed horribly, raising herself
upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Hornigold!" she cried. "What have you done
with the child?"</p>

<p>"I left him at Cuchillo, outside the walls," answered
the man.</p>

<p>"And the cross?"</p>

<p>"On his breast. The Captain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The marriage lines were there. You betrayed
me. May God's curse&mdash;nay, I die. For Christ's
sake&mdash;I forgive&mdash;Francisco, Francisco."</p>

<p>She fell back gasping on the sand. He tore the enclosing
coif from her face. In a vain effort to hold
back death's hand for another second, Hornigold
snatched a spirit flask from his belt and strove to
force a drop between her lips. It was too late. She
was gone. He knew the signs too well. He laid her
back on the sand, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Curse her! Why couldn't she have lived a
moment longer? The Captain's brat&mdash;and she might
have told me. Bring up the prisoners!" he cried to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the guards, who had moved them out of earshot of
this strange conversation.</p>

<p>"The cross," he muttered, "the marriage lines
therein. The only clew. And yet she cried 'Francisco.'
That was the name. Who is he? If I could
find that cross. I'd know it among a thousand.
Hither," he called to the prisoners slowly approaching.</p>

<p>"The good sister?" queried Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>As the young soldier, with an ejaculation of pity,
bent forward in the moonlight to look upon the
face of the dead woman, from his torn doublet a
silver crucifix suddenly swung before the eyes of the
old buccaneer.</p>

<p>"By heaven!" he cried. "'Tis the cross."</p>

<p>He stepped nearer to Alvarado, seized the carven
crucifix, and lifted it to the light.</p>

<p>"I could swear it was the same," he muttered.
"Se&ntilde;or, your name and rank?"</p>

<p>"I can not conceive that either concerns a bloodthirsty
ruffian like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop! Perhaps there is more in this than thou
thinkest," said Mercedes. "Tell him, Alvarado. It
can do no harm. Oh, se&ntilde;or, have pity on us! Unbind
me," she added, "I give you my word. I wish
but to pay my respect to the woman yonder."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"She gives good counsel, soldier," answered the
boatswain. "Cut her lashing," he said to the sailor
who guarded them.</p>

<p>As the buccaneer did so, Mercedes sank on her
knees by the side of the dead woman.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, your name?" asked Hornigold again.</p>

<p>"Alvarado."</p>

<p>"Where got you that name?"</p>

<p>"It was given me by His Excellency, the Viceroy."</p>

<p>"And wherefore?"</p>

<p>There was something so tremendous in Hornigold's
interest that in spite of himself the young man
felt compelled to answer.</p>

<p>"It was his pleasure."</p>

<p>"Had you not a name of your own?"</p>

<p>"None that I know of."</p>

<p>"What mean you?"</p>

<p>"I was found, a baby, outside the walls of Panama
in a little village. The Viceroy adopted me and
brought me up. That is all."</p>

<p>"When was this?" asked Hornigold.</p>

<p>"After the sack of Panama. And the name of
the village was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cuchillo&mdash;&mdash;" interrupted Hornigold triumphantly.</p>

<p>"My God, se&ntilde;or, how know you that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was there."</p>

<p>"You were there?" cried the young man.</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"For love of heaven, can you tell me who I am,
what I am?"</p>

<p>"In good time, young sir, and for a price. At
present I know but one thing."</p>

<p>"That is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There lies your mother," answered the buccaneer
slowly, pointing to the white figure on the
sand.</p>

<p>"My mother! Madre de Dios!" cried Alvarado,
stepping forward and looking down upon the upturned
face with its closely cut white hair, showing
beautiful in the moonlight. "God rest her soul,
she hath a lovely face and died in defence of her
honor like the gentlewoman she should be. My
mother&mdash;how know you this?"</p>

<p>"In the sack of Panama a woman gave me a male
child, and for money I agreed to take it and leave it
in a safe and secluded spot outside the city walls. I
carried it at the hazard of my life as far as Cuchillo
and there left it."</p>

<p>"But how know you that the child you left is
I?"</p>

<p>"Around the baby's neck the mother, ere she
gave him to me, placed this curious cross you wear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
'Tis of such cunning workmanship that there is
naught like it under the sun that ever I have seen.
I knew it even in the faint light when my eyes fell
upon it. I left the child with a peasant woman to
take him where I had been directed. I believed him
safe. On leaving Panama that village lay in our
backward path. We burned it down. I saw the
baby again. Because I had been well paid I saved
him from instant death at the hands of the buccaneers,
who would have tossed him in the air on the
point of their spears. I shoved the crucifix, which
would have tempted them because it was silver,
underneath the dress and left the child. He was
alive when we departed."</p>

<p>"And the day after," cried Alvarado, "de Lara's
troops came through that village and found me still
wearing that cross. My mother! Loving God, can
it be? But my father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What shall I have if I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Riches, wealth, all&mdash;Set us free and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not now. I can not now. Wait."</p>

<p>"At least, Donna Mercedes."</p>

<p>"Man, 'twould be my life that would pay; but I'll
keep careful watch over her. I have yet some influence
with the Captain. To-morrow I'll find a way to
free you&mdash;you must do the rest."</p>

<p>"Mercedes," said Alvarado, "heardst thou all?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"But little," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"That lady&mdash;is believed to have been my
mother!"</p>

<p>"Gentle or simple," said the girl, "she died in defence
of her honor, like the noblest, the best. This
for thee, good sister," she whispered, bending down
and kissing the pale forehead. "And may I do the
like when my time comes. Thou shouldst be proud
of her, my Alvarado," she said, looking up at him.
"See!" she cried suddenly as the resemblance,
which was indeed strong between them, struck her.
"Thou hast her face. Her white hair was once
golden like thine. He tells the truth. Oh, sir, for
Christ's sake, have pity upon us!"</p>

<p>A messenger came staggering toward them across
the woods.</p>

<p>"Master Hornigold," he cried.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay."</p>

<p>"We've taken the town. The Captain wants you
and your prisoners. You'll find him in the guard
room. Oh, ho, there's merry times to-night in La
Guayra! All hell's let loose, and we are devils."
He laughed boisterously and drunkenly as he spoke
and lurched backward over the sands.</p>

<p>"We must be gone," said Hornigold. "Rise, mistress.
Come, sir."</p>

<p>"But this lady," urged Alvarado&mdash;his lips could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
scarcely form the unfamiliar word "mother"&mdash;"and
the good priest? You will not leave them here?"</p>

<p>"The rising tide will bear them out to sea."</p>

<p>"A moment&mdash;by your leave," said Alvarado, stepping
toward the dead. Assisted by Mercedes, for he
was still bound, he stooped down and touched his
lips to those of the dead woman, whispering a
prayer as he did so. Rising to his feet he cried:</p>

<p>"But my father&mdash;who is he&mdash;who was he?"</p>

<p>"We shall find that out."</p>

<p>"But his name?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, I can not tell now," answered Hornigold
evasively; "but with this clew the rest should
be easy. Trust me, and when we can discuss this
matter undisturbed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I would know now!"</p>

<p>"You forget, young sir, that you are a prisoner,
and must suit your will to my pleasure. Forward!"</p>

<p>But the soul of the old buccaneer was filled with
fierce joy. He thought he knew the secret of the
crucifix now. The Spanish captain's mother lay
dead upon the sands, but his father lived. He was
sure of it. He would free Alvarado and bring him
down upon Morgan. He chuckled with fiendish delight
as he limped along. He had his revenge now;
it lay in the hollow of his hand, and 'twas a rare one
indeed. Mercedes being bound again, the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
party marched across the beach and the bodies of
the priest and the nun were left alone while the
night tide came rippling up the strand.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the party disappeared within the gate
of the fort when the priest slowly and painfully
lifted himself on his hands and crawled toward the
woman. While the buccaneer had talked with the
abbess he had returned to consciousness and had
listened. Bit by bit he gathered the details of her
story, and in truth he knew it of old. By turning
his head he had seen the crucifix on the young man's
breast and he also had recognized it. He lay still
and silent, however, feigning death, for to have discovered
himself would have resulted in his instant
despatch. When they had gone he painfully crawled
over to the body of the poor nun.</p>

<p>"Isabella," he murmured, giving her her birth
name, "thou didst suffer. Thou tookest thine own
life, but the loving God will forgive thee. I am glad
that I had strength and courage to absolve thee before
I fell. And I did not know thee. 'Tis so many
years since. Thy son, that brave young captain&mdash;I
will see thee righted. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He moved nearer to her, scrutinizing her carefully,
and then, with an apology even to the dead,
the old man opened the front of her gown.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, I thought so," he said, as his eye caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
a glimpse of a gold chain against her white neck.
Gently he lifted it, unclasped it, drew it forth.
There was a locket upon it. Jewels sparkled upon
its surface. She had worn it all these years.</p>

<p>"<i>O, vanitas vanitatum!</i>" murmured the priest,
yet compassionately. "What is it that passes the
love of woman?"</p>

<p>He slipped it quietly within the breast of his habit
and then fell prostrate on the sand, faint from pain
and loss of blood. Long the two figures lay there in
the moonlight while the rising tide lipped the shining
sands. The cool water at last restored consciousness
to one of the still forms, but though they laved
the beautiful face of the other with tender caresses
they could not call back the troubled life that had
passed into peaceful eternity. Painfully the old
priest raised himself upon his hands and looked
about him.</p>

<p>"O God!" he murmured, "give me strength to
live until I can tell the story. Sister Maria Christina&mdash;Isabella
that was&mdash;thou were brave and thou
wert beautiful; thou hast served our Holy Church
long and well. If I could only lay thee in some consecrated
ground&mdash;but soul like to thine makes holy
e'en the sea which shall bear thee away. Shriven
thou wert, buried thou shalt be."</p>

<p>The man struggled to his knees, clasped his hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
before him, and began the burial service of his ancient
Church.</p>

<p>"We therefore commit her body into the great
deep," he said, "looking for the general resurrection
in the last day, and the life of the world to
come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The water was washing around him ere he finished
his mournful task, and with one long look of benison
and farewell he rose to his feet and staggered along
the road down the beach. Slowly he went, but presently
he reached the turn where began the ascent of
the mountain. Before he proceeded he halted and
looked long toward the flaming, shrieking, ruined
town. The flooding tide was in now and the breakers
were beating and thundering far across the
sands. The body of the abbess was gone.</p>

<p>The old man drew himself up, lifted his trembling
hands and prayed; he prayed again for the soul of
the woman; he prayed for the young man, that he
might learn the truth; he prayed for the beautiful
damsel who loved him; he prayed for the people,
the hapless people of the doomed town, the helpless,
outraged women, the bereft mothers, the tortured
men, the murdered children, and as he prayed he
called down the curse of God upon those who had
wrought such ruin.</p>

<p>"Slay them, O God! Strike and spare not! Cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
them off root and branch who have despoiled thy
people Israel. They have taken the sword and may
they perish by it as was promised of old!"</p>

<p>A gray, grim, gaunt figure, bloodstained, pale, he
stood there in that ghastly light, invoking the judgment
of God upon Morgan and his men ere he turned
away and was lost in the darkness of the mountain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WHICH DESCRIBES AN AUDIENCE WITH SIR HENRY MORGAN
AND THE TREACHERY BY WHICH CAPTAIN ALVARADO
IS BENEFITED</p>

<p>he clock on the wall was striking eleven
as Hornigold forced his prisoners into
the guardroom of the first fort that had
been captured, which, as it was the
larger of the two, Morgan
had selected as his
head quarters. Mercedes'
soul had turned to
stone at the sights and
sounds which met her as
she passed through the
town where the hellish
revelry was now in full
blast. The things she
witnessed and heard were
enough to appall the stoutest heart that ever beat
within the rudest breast. She forgot her own danger
in her sympathy for the suffering inhabitants of the
devoted town. Ghastly pale and sick with horror,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
she tottered and staggered as she entered the room.
As for the Se&ntilde;ora Agapida, she had collapsed long
since, and for the last one hundred yards of the
journey had been dragged helplessly along by two of
her captors, who threw her in a senseless heap on the
stone flagging of the great vaulted chamber.</p>

<p>The agony and suffering, the torture and death,
the shame and dishonor of his people affected Alvarado
differently. His soul flamed within his breast
with pity for the one, rage for the other. He lusted
and thirsted to break away and single-handed rush
upon the human wolves and tigers, who were despoiling
women, torturing men, murdering children, as if
they had been devils. The desire mastered him, and
he writhed and struggled in his bonds, but unavailingly.</p>

<p>It was a haggard, distracted pair, therefore, which
was brought before the chief buccaneer. Morgan
sat at the head of the guardroom, on a platform,
a table before him strewn with reckless prodigality
with vessels of gold and silver stolen from altar and
sideboard indifferently, some piled high with food,
others brimming with a variety of liquors, from the
rich old wines of Xeres to the fiery native rum. On
one side of the captain was a woman. Pale as a
ghost, the young and beautiful widow of a
slaughtered officer, in her disordered array she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
shrank terrified beneath his hand. L'Ollonois, Teach
and de Lussan were also in the room. By each one
cowered another woman prisoner. Teach was roaring
out a song, that song of London town, with its
rollicking chorus:</p>

<p>
"Though life now is pleasant and sweet to the sense,<br />
We'll be damnably moldy a hundred years hence."<br />
</p>

<p>The room was full of plunder of one sort and another,
and the buccaneers were being served by
frightened negro slaves, their footsteps quickened
and their obedience enforced by the sight of a dead
black in one corner, whom de Lussan had knifed a
short time since because he had been slow in coming
to his call. The smell of spilled liquor, of burnt
powder, and of blood, indescribable and sickening,
hung in the close, hot air. Lamps and candles were
flaring and spluttering in the room but the greater
illumination came through the open casements from
the roaring fires of burning houses outside. The
temptation to join in the sack of the town had been
too much for Hornigold's remaining men, consequently
he and those conveying Se&ntilde;ora Agapida
alone attended the prisoners. These last, after
throwing the duenna recklessly upon the floor, hurried
out after the rest, leaving the officers and women
alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence!" roared Morgan, as his eye fell upon
the group entering the lower end of the great hall.
"Pipe down, thou bellowing bull!" he shouted,
throwing a silver cup that Cellini might have chased,
at the head of the half drunken Teach. "Who's
there? Scuttle me, 'tis our spitfire and the gallant
captain, with that worthy seaman Hornigold! Advance,
friends. Thou art welcome to our cheer.
Drive them forward, Hornigold," he cried, as he
saw Mercedes and Alvarado made no attempt to
move.</p>

<p>"Advance quickly," whispered Hornigold to Alvarado;
"to cross him now were death."</p>

<p>Seizing them with a great show of force he shoved
them down the hall to the foot of the platform, in
front of the revellers.</p>

<p>"I welcome thee to our court, fair lady, and you,
brave sir. What say ye, gentles all? Rum for the
noble captain, here, and wine for the lady," called
out Morgan, bowing over the table in malicious mockery.</p>

<p>"I drink with no murderer," said Alvarado firmly,
thrusting the negro, who proffered him a glass,
violently aside with his shoulder, causing him to
topple over, drenching himself with the liquor.</p>

<p>"Ha! Is it so?" laughed Morgan in a terrible
manner. "Hark'ee, my young cock, thou shalt crave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
and beg and pray for another drink at my hand presently&mdash;and
get it not. But there is another cup thou
shalt drink, ay, and that to the dregs. Back, you! I
would speak with the lady. Well, Donna Mercedes,"
he continued, "art still in that prideful mood?"</p>

<p>Silence. The girl stood erect, disdainfully looking
him full in the face.</p>

<p>"I shall break thee yet, proud wench!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the demoiselle is jealous of thy present
companion, Sir Captain," sneered de Lussan
smoothly in his courtliest manner.</p>

<p>"Scuttle me! That's well thought on," laughed
Morgan. "And I'll add fuel to the fire."</p>

<p>As he spoke he clasped the terrified woman on his
right around the waist, and though she struggled and
drew away from him in horror and disgust, he kissed
her full upon the lips. The woman shuddered loathingly
when he released her, put her face down in
her hands and sobbed low and bitterly.</p>

<p>"What sayest thou to that, sweet Mercedes?"</p>

<p>"I say may God have mercy on the soul of yon
poor woman," answered Mercedes disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Best pray for thine own soul, madam," he roared.
"Come hither! What, you move not? Black Dog,
Black Dog, I say!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>The huge maroon lurched from behind his
master's chair, where he had lain half-drunken.</p>

<p>"Fetch me that woman!"</p>

<p>Mercedes was bound and could not at first release
her hands, but as the maroon shambled toward her
she sprang back struggling.</p>

<p>"Alvarado, Alvarado!" she screamed. "Help
me, save me!"</p>

<p>Like a maddened bull, though his hands were
bound also, Alvarado threw himself upon the negro.
The force with which he struck him hurled him
backward and the two fell to the floor, the maroon
beneath. His head struck a corner of the step with
a force that would have killed a white man. In an
instant, however, the unbound negro was on his feet.
He whipped out his dagger and would have plunged
it into the breast of the prostrate Spaniard had not
Mercedes, lightly bound, for being a woman they
thought it not necessary to be unusually severe in
her lashings, wrenched free her hands and caught
the half-breed's upraised arm.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" she screamed, while struggling to
divert the blow, looking toward Morgan.</p>

<p>"Hold your hand, Black Dog," answered that
worthy. "Leave the man and come hither. This
is thy first appeal, lady. You know my power at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
last, eh? Down on your knees and beg for his
life!"</p>

<p>Instantly Mercedes sank to her knees and
stretched out her hands, a piteous, appealing, lovely
figure.</p>

<p>"Spare him, spare him!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What would you do for him?"</p>

<p>"My life for his," she answered bravely.</p>

<p>"Nay, Mercedes," interposed Alvarado, "let him
work his will on me."</p>

<p>"There are worse places, thou seest, lady, than by
my side," sneered Morgan. "By heaven, 'twas a
pretty play, was it not, mates? I spare him, but
remember, 'tis for you. Harry Morgan's way. Now
reward me. Hither, I say! Go, you woman!" he
struck the woman he had kissed a fierce blow with
his naked fist&mdash;"Away from me! Your place is
needed for your betters. Here lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain Morgan," cried Hornigold, suddenly interrupting
him. "I bethink me you should send
men to seize the mountain pass that leads to Caracas
at once, else we may have troops upon us in the
morning."</p>

<p>It was a bold diversion and yet it succeeded.
There could be no safe feasting in La Guayra with
that open road. Morgan had overlooked it, but the
boatswain's words recalled it to him; for the moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
he forgot the prisoners and the women. Safety
was a paramount consideration.</p>

<p>"I forgot it," he answered. "Curse me, how can
I? The villains are too drunk with rum and blood
and fury to be despatched."</p>

<p>"A force must be assembled at once," urged Hornigold,
insistently, "lest some have escaped who
would bring word to the Viceroy. He would be
upon us in a day with an army too great for resistance.
If you intend not to rot here in La Guayra,
or be caught in a death trap, we must be up to the
mountain top beforehand. Once they seize the pass,
we are helpless."</p>

<p>"That's well said, Hornigold," cried Morgan, who
was not so drunk that he could not realize the practical
value of Hornigold's suggestion and the great
danger of disregarding his advice. "The pass must
be seized at all hazard. With that in our possession
we may bide our time. I thought to wait until to-morrow,
but you're right. We've feasted and drunk
enough for the night. To-morrow Donna de Lara!
Guards for the pass now&mdash;But how to get them?"</p>

<p>He rose to his feet as he spoke and came down the
hall.</p>

<p>"Teach and L'Ollonois, follow me!" he cried.
"Gather up fifty of the soberest men and lead them
up the mountain road till you reach the pass, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
then hold it till I come. Nay, no hesitation," he
roared. "Canst not see the necessity? Unless we
are masters of that pass we are caught like rats in a
trap here in La Guayra. To-morrow or the next
day we shall march up toward Caracas. Your share
of the treasure and your women shall be held safe.
You shall have first consideration on the other side
of the mountains. Nay, I will have it so!" He
stamped his foot in furious rage. "We've all had
too much drink already," he continued, "now we
must make things secure. Hornigold, take charge
of this fort. I leave the prisoners with you. Guard
them well. Treat the lady well also. Do what you
like with the other, only keep him alive. One of
you send Braziliano to me. He shall have the other
fort. And you and I, Monsieur de Lussan, will take
account of the men here in the town and bring them
into such order as we can."</p>

<p>Although Teach and L'Ollonois had no mind to
leave the pleasures open to them in La Guayra, yet
they were both men of intelligence and could easily
see the absolute necessity for the precaution suggested
by Hornigold and accepted by their captain.
If they held the passage over the mountains, and
fifty men could hold it against a thousand, no Spaniard
could come at them. So the little group, leaving
the wretched women, the two prisoners, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Hornigold, sallied out into the infernal night. It
was a difficult thing for them to find a sufficient
number of sober pirates, but by persuading, threatening,
and compelling they at last gathered a force
of the least drunken knaves, with which they set
forth on the road.</p>

<p>The fires which had been wantonly kindled in
different places by the buccaneers were making such
headway that Morgan instantly saw that especial
efforts would be needed to prevent the complete
destruction of the town. He wanted La Guayra for
his base of supplies for the present, and with tremendous
energy, seconded by de Lussan and some of
the soberer men, he routed out the buccaneers and
set them to work.</p>

<p>"You have saved me for the moment," said Mercedes,
gratefully, turning to Hornigold as he led her
away from the hall.</p>

<p>"'Twas not for care of you," hissed out the old
man, malevolently, "but that I'd fain balk him in
every desire he cherishes, even of possessing you."</p>

<p>"Whatever it was, I am thankful, se&ntilde;or. You
have my prayers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Prayers," laughed the old sailor, "it hath been
sixty years since I heard those canting Puritans, my
mother and father, pray. I want no prayers. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
come, I must put you in ward. There should be
strong-rooms in this castle."</p>

<p>He summoned a slave and found what he wanted.
Mercedes, and Se&ntilde;ora Agapida, who was fetched by
other slaves, were locked in one room, Alvarado was
thrust into another. As soon as he could do so, after
making some provision for the comfort of the
woman, Hornigold came down to him.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or," he said, "the band is drunk and helpless.
One hundred resolute men could master them.
Morgan means to march to Caracas to-morrow. He
can not get his men in shape to do so as long as
liquor flows in La Guayra. If I set you free, what
can you do?"</p>

<p>"There is a way over the mountains," answered
Alvarado. "A secret way, known only to the Indians."</p>

<p>"Know you this path?"</p>

<p>"It has been pointed out to me."</p>

<p>"Is it a practicable way?"</p>

<p>"It has been abandoned for fifty years, but I
could follow it to Caracas."</p>

<p>"And once there, what then?"</p>

<p>"There, if the Viceroy be not gone, and I do not
believe he has yet departed, are one thousand soldiers
to re-take the city."</p>

<p>"And if they be gone?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll raise the citizens, the household guards, the
savages, and the slaves!"</p>

<p>"Can you do it?"</p>

<p>"Free me and see," answered Alvarado, with such
resolution that he convinced the sailor. "The men
of Caracas love the daughter of the Viceroy. They
are not inexperienced in arms. I will lead them.
The advantage of numbers will be with us. If you
free me, I take it we will have a friend within the
walls. Success is certain. We have too much to
revenge," he added, his face flushing with rage at
the thought of it all.</p>

<p>"That's well," answered Hornigold. "If I free
you what reward shall I have?"</p>

<p>"I will cover you with treasure."</p>

<p>"And guarantee my life and liberty?"</p>

<p>"They shall be held inviolate."</p>

<p>"We captured the Porto Bello plate ship, and
were wrecked two days ago a league or so to the
westward&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw the ship the day of the storm, but marked
it not," interrupted the officer.</p>

<p>"Ay. We buried the treasure. Shall I have my
share?"</p>

<p>"All that thou canst take, if the honor of the
lady be preserved. I answer for the Viceroy."</p>

<p>"Will you swear it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"By your mother's cross?"</p>

<p>"By my mother's cross, I swear. I will keep my
faith with you, so help me God!"</p>

<p>"I believe in no God, but you do, and that suffices.
You shall go," cried the buccaneer, all his objections
satisfied. "But as you love the woman, lose
no time. I'll be at the west gate under the rocks at
ten o'clock to-morrow night. You know it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, go on."</p>

<p>"I'll open the gate for you and leave the rest to
you. You must be there with your force. Now, go."</p>

<p>"I shall be there. But I can not leave without
Donna Mercedes."</p>

<p>"And you can't go with her. Think! Could she
make her way over the mountains?"</p>

<p>"No, no, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll watch over her with my life," urged the
One-Eyed. "My share of the treasure depends
upon her safety, you said."</p>

<p>"But Morgan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hate him with a hatred greater than thine."</p>

<p>"He is thy captain."</p>

<p>"He betrayed me, and I swore to take such vengeance
as was never heard before, to make him
suffer such torments by my hand as were never felt
outside of hell."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would betray him?"</p>

<p>"It was for that I came with him! for that I live.
He craves and covets the Donna Mercedes. He shall
not have her. Trust me to interpose at the last
moment."</p>

<p>"Is this true? Can I believe you?"</p>

<p>"Else why should I jeopard my life by freeing
you? I hate him, I tell you. Remember! The
west gate! There are not three hundred men here.
The best fifty have gone with Teach and L'Ollonois,
the rest are drunken and cowards. Here are
weapons. Wrap yourself in this cloak, and come.
Say no word to any one on the way. By Satan, as
you love the wench, lose no time!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old man cut the bonds of Alvarado,
belted upon him dagger and sword, thrust a
charged pistol in his hand, covered his head with a
steel cap, and threw a long cloak around him. The
two then went forth into the night. Avoiding the
notice of others, they hastened along the deserted
parapet, for there were none to keep watch or guard,
until they came to one of the ladders by which the
buccaneers had entered the town. Down it Alvarado,
first swearing again on the cross, on his
honor, to respect his agreement with Hornigold and
again receiving the man's assurance, dropped hastily
to the ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no one to look, and he dashed recklessly
across the narrow strip of sand to the shadow of the
cliffs, along which he ran until he came opposite the
place of his mother's death. The white water was
rolling and crashing on the beach, and the body was
gone. With a hasty petition for the repose of her
soul, he ran on until he reached the turn of the
road. There, like the priest, he made another prayer,
and it was a prayer not different from that which
had been voiced so short a time before.</p>

<p>But his petitions were soon over. It was a time
for work, not prayer. No moment could be lost.
He girded up his loins and turned away on the run.
Unlike the priest, however, he did not pursue the
mountain road, but, after going a short distance, he
left the way and plunged to the right through the
trees directly up the side of the hill.</p>

<p>His face was cut and slashed by Morgan's dagger;
his soul had been racked and torn by the scenes he
had gone through; the plight of Mercedes stirred
him to the very depths; his heart yearned over the
slaughtered garrison, the ruined town, but with a
strength superhuman he plunged at the hill, in spite
of the forest, groping about in the darkness with
frantic energy until he found the traces of a slender,
rocky path which led over the mountains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>he day after the sack of the town had
been a busy one for the buccaneers.
First of all, Morgan had striven, and
with some success, to restore some sort
of order within the walls. By the aid of his officers
and some of the soberest men he had confiscated all
of the liquor that he could come at, and had stored it
under a strong guard in the west fort, which he
selected as his headquarters. The Governor's palace
on the hill above was a more fitting and luxurious
residence and it had been promptly seized, the few
defenders having fled, in the morning; but for the
present Morgan deemed it best to remain in the city
and in close touch with his men.</p>

<p>The Spanish soldiery had been cut down to a man
the night before, and the majority of the hapless
citizens had been killed, wounded or tortured. The
unfortunates who were yet alive were driven into
the church of San Lorenzo, where they were kept
without food, water, or attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>There were some children, also, who had survived
the night, for the buccaneers, frenzied with
slaughter and inflamed with rum, had tossed many
of them on their sword-points when they came
across them in the streets. By Morgan's orders the
living were collected in the store-house and barracks
of the Guinea Trading Company, a corporation
which supplied slaves to the South American
countries, and which had branches in every city on
the Caribbean. He did order food and water to be
given these helpless unfortunates, so their condition
was not quite so deplorable as that of the rest. It
was bad enough, however, and the old barracks
which had echoed with the sound of many a bitter
cry from the forlorn lips of wretched slaves, now
resounded with the wailing of these terrified little
ones.</p>

<p>The condition of the women of the city was beyond
description. They, too, were herded together
in another building, an ancient convent, but were
plentifully supplied with every necessary they could
ask for. Death, in lieu of the fate that had come
upon them, would have been welcomed by many a
high-born dame and her humbler sister as well, but
they were all carefully searched and deprived of
everything that might serve as a weapon. They
were crowded together indiscriminately, high and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
low, rich and poor, black or white or red, in all states
of disorder and disarray, just as they had been seized
the night before, some of them having been dragged
from their very beds by the brutal ruffians.</p>

<p>Some of the women, maddened to frenzy by the
treatment they had received, screamed and raved;
but most of them were filled with still misery, overwhelmed
by silent despair&mdash;waiting hopelessly for
they knew not what bitter, degrading end. One
night had changed them from happy wives, honored
mothers, light-hearted, innocent girls, to wrecks of
womanhood. The light of life was dead in them.
They were dumb and unprotesting. The worst had
come upon them; there was nothing of sorrow and
shame they had not tasted. What mattered anything
else? Their husbands, fathers, children,
lovers had gone. Homes were broken up; their
property was wasted, and not even honor was left.
They prayed to die. It was all that was left to them.</p>

<p>The gates of the town and forts were closed and
some slight attempt was made to institute a patrol
of the walls, although the guard that was kept was
negligent to the point of contempt. As no enemy
was apprehended Morgan did not rigorously insist
upon strict watch. Many of the buccaneers were
still sodden with liquor and could be of no service
until they were sobered. They were dragged to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
barracks, drenched with water, and left to recover
as best they could.</p>

<p>Fortune favored them in one other matter, too,
in that late in the afternoon a handsome frigate
bringing despatches from Carthagena, ran in and
anchored in the roadstead. Her officers at once came
ashore to pay their respects to the Commandante of
the port and forward their papers to the Viceroy.
Before they suspected anything, they were seized
and ruthlessly murdered. To take possession of the
frigate thereafter was a work of no special difficulty.
The crew were disposed of as their officers had been,
and the buccaneers rejoiced greatly at the good luck
that had brought them so fine a ship. On the next
morning Morgan intended to march toward Caracas,
whence, after plundering that town and exacting a
huge ransom for the lives of those he spared, he
would lead his band back to La Guayra, embark on
the frigate, and then bear away for the Isthmus.</p>

<p>During the day, Hornigold, whose wound incapacitated
him from active movement, remained in
command of the fort with special instructions to
look after Mercedes. By Morgan's orders she and
her companion were removed to the best room in the
fort and luxuriously provided for. He had not discovered
the escape of Alvarado, partly because he
took no manner of interest in that young man and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
only kept him alive to influence the girl, and partly
because Hornigold had assured him that the prisoner
was taking his confinement very hardly, that he was
mad with anger, in a raging fever of disappointment
and anxiety, and was constantly begging to see the
captain. The boatswain cunningly suggested that it
would be just as well to let Alvarado remain in solitude,
without food or water until the next day, by
which time, the boatswain argued, he would be reduced
to a proper condition of humility and servitude.
Morgan found this advice good. It was quite
in consonance with his desires and his practices. He
would have killed Alvarado out of hand had he not
considered him the most favorable card with which
to play the game he was waging with Mercedes for
her consent to marry him.</p>

<p>So far as he was capable of a genuine affection,
he loved the proud Spanish maiden. He would fain
persuade her willingly to come to his arms rather
than enforce her consent or overcome her scruples
by brute strength. There would be something of a
triumph in winning her, and this vain, bloodstained
old brute fancied that he had sufficient attractiveness
for the opposite sex to render him invincible if
he set about his wooing in the right way. He thought
he knew the way, too. At any rate he was disposed
to try it. Here again Hornigold, upon whom in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
absence of Teach he depended more and more, and
in whom he confided as of old, advised him.</p>

<p>"I know women," said that worthy, and indeed
no man had more knowledge of the class which stood
for women in his mind than he, "and all you want
is to give her time. Wait until she knows what's
happened to the rest of them, and sees only you have
power to protect her, and she will come to heel right
enough. Besides, you haven't given her half a
chance. She's only seen you weapon in hand. She
doesn't know what a man you are, Captain. Sink
me, if I'd your looks instead of this old, scarred, one-eyed
face, there'd be no man I'd give way to and no
woman I'd not win! Steer her along gently with an
easy helm. Don't jam her up into the wind all of a
sudden. Women have to be coaxed. Leave the girl
alone a watch. Don't go near her; let her think
what she pleases. Don't let anybody go near her
unless it's me, and she won't get anything out of
me, you can depend upon that! She'll be so anxious
to talk to you in the morning that you can make her
do anything. Then if you can starve that Spanish
dog and break his spirit, so that she'll see him crawling
at your feet, she'll sicken of him and turn to a
man."</p>

<p>"Scuttle me," laughed Morgan, "your advice is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
good! I didn't know you knew so much about the
sex."</p>

<p>"I've mixed up considerable with them in sixty
years, Captain," leered the old man. "What I
don't know about them ain't worth knowing."</p>

<p>"It seems so. Well, I'll stay away from her till
the morning. I shall be busy anyway trying to
straighten out these drunken sots, and do you put
the screws on that captain and leave the lady alone&mdash;but
see that she lacks nothing."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, trust me for them both."</p>

<p>Hornigold found means during the day&mdash;and it
was a matter of no little difficulty to elude the
guards he himself had placed there&mdash;to inform Mercedes
of the escape of Alvarado, and to advise her
that he expected the return of that young man with
the troops of the Viceroy at ten o'clock that night.
He bade her be of good cheer, that he did not think
it likely that Morgan would think of calling upon
her or of sending for her until morning, when it
would be too late. He promised that he would watch
over her and do what he could to protect her; that he
would never leave the fort except for a few moments
before ten that night, when he went to admit Alvarado.
What was better earnest of his purpose was
that he furnished her with a keen dagger, small
enough to conceal in the bosom of her dress, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
advised her if worst came to worst, and there was no
other way, to use it. He impressed on her that on
no account was she to allow Morgan to get the
slightest inkling of his communication to her, for if
the chief buccaneer found this out Hornigold's life
would not be worth a moment's thought, and Alvarado
would be balked in his plans of rescue.</p>

<p>Mercedes most thankfully received the weapon
and promised to respect the confidence. She was
grateful beyond measure, and he found it necessary
harshly to admonish her that he only assisted her
because he had promised Alvarado that she should
receive no harm, and that his own safety depended
upon hers. He did not say so, but under other circumstances
he would have as ruthlessly appropriated
her for himself as Morgan intended to do, and without
the shadow of a scruple.</p>

<p>As far as creature comforts were concerned the
two women fared well. Indeed, they were sumptuously,
lavishly, prodigally provided for. Se&ntilde;ora
Agapida was still in a state of complete prostration.
She lay helpless on a couch in the apartment and
ministering to her distracted the poor girl's mind,
yet such a day as Mercedes de Lara passed she
prayed she might never again experience. The town
was filled with the shouts and cries of the buccaneers
wandering to and fro, singing drunken choruses, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and again routing out hidden fugitives from places
of fancied security and torturing them with ready
ingenuity whenever they were taken. The confusion
was increased and the noise diversified by the
shrieks and groans of these miserable wretches.
Sometimes the voices that came through the high
windows were those of women, and the sound of
their screams made the heart of the brave girl sink
like lead in her breast.</p>

<p>For the rest, she did not understand Hornigold's
position. She did not know whether to believe him
or not, but of one thing was she certain. Whereas
she had been defenceless now she had a weapon, and
she could use it if necessary. With that in hand she
was mistress at least of her own fate.</p>

<p>As evening drew on, every thing having been
attended to, Morgan began to tire of his isolation,
and time hung heavy on his hands. He was weary
of the women whom he had hitherto consorted with;
the other officers, between whom and himself there
was no sort of friendship, were busy with their own
nefarious wickednesses in the different parts of the
fort or town, and he sat a long time alone in the
guardroom, drinking, Black Dog, as usual, pouring
at his side. The liquor inflamed his imagination and
he craved companionship. Summoning Hornigold at
last, he bade him bring Donna Mercedes before him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
The old man attempted to expostulate, but Morgan's
mood had changed and he brooked no hesitation in
obeying any order given by him. There was nothing
for the boatswain to do but to comply.</p>

<p>Once more Mercedes, therefore, found herself in
the guardroom of the fort in the presence of the
man she loathed and feared above all others in creation.
Her situation, however, was vastly different
from what it had been. On the first occasion there
had appeared no hope. Now Alvarado was free and
she had a weapon. She glanced at the clock, a
recent importation from Spain hanging upon the
wall, as she entered, and saw that it was half-after
nine. Ten was the hour Hornigold had appointed to
meet Alvarado at the gate. She hoped that he
would be early rather than late; and, if she could
withstand the buccaneer by persuasion, seeming
compliance, or by force, for a short space, all would
be well. For she never doubted that her lover
would come for her. Even if he had to come single-handed
and alone to fight for her, she knew he would
be there. Therefore, with every nerve strained almost
to the breaking point to ward off his advances
and to delay any action he might contemplate, she
faced the buccaneer.</p>

<p>He was dressed with barbaric magnificence in the
riches and plunder he had appropriated, and he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
adorned his person with a profusion of silver and
gold, and stolen gems. He had been seated at the
table while served by the maroon, but, as she entered,
with unusual complaisance he arose and
bowed to her with something of the grace of a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, endeavoring to make soft and
agreeable his harsh voice, "I trust you have been
well treated since in my charge."</p>

<p>He had been drinking heavily she saw, but as he
spoke her fair she would answer him accordingly.
To treat him well, to temporize, and not to inflame
his latent passion by unnecessarily crossing him,
would be her best policy, she instantly divined, although
she hated and despised him none the less.
On his part, he had determined to try the gentler
arts of persuasion, and though his face still bore the
welts made by her riding whip the night before he
strove to forget it and play the gentleman. He had
some qualities, as a buccaneer, that might entitle him
to a certain respect, but when he essayed the gentleman
his performance was so futile that had it not
been so terrible it would have been ludicrous. She
answered his question calmly without exhibiting
resentment or annoyance.</p>

<p>"We have been comfortably lodged and provided
with food and drink in sufficiency, se&ntilde;or."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what more would you have, Donna Mercedes?"</p>

<p>"Liberty, sir!"</p>

<p>"That shall be yours. Saving only my will, when
you are married to me, you shall be as free as air.
A free sailor and his free wife, lady. But will you
not sit down?"</p>

<p>In compliance with his request, she seated herself
on a chair which happened to be near where she
stood; she noted with relief that the table was between
them.</p>

<p>"Nay, not there," said the Captain instantly.
"Here, madam, here, at my side."</p>

<p>"Not yet, se&ntilde;or capitan; it were not fit that a
prisoner should occupy so high a seat of honor.
Wait until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until what, pray?" he cried, leaning forward.</p>

<p>"Until that&mdash;until I&mdash;until we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In spite of her efforts she could not force her lips
to admit the possibility of the realization of his
desire.</p>

<p>"Until you are Lady Morgan?" he cried, his face
flaming.</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands at his suggestion,
for she feared her horror in the thought would
show too plainly there; and then because she dare
not lose sight of him, she constrained herself to look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
at him once more. Her cheeks were burning with
shame, her eyes flashing with indignation, though
she forced her lips into the semblance of a smile.</p>

<p>"That surprises you, does it?" continued the man
with boasting condescension. "You did not think
I designed so to honor you after last night, madam?
Scuttle me, these"&mdash;pointing to his face&mdash;"are
fierce love taps, but I fancy a strong will&mdash;when I
can break it to mine own," he muttered, "and I have
yet to see that in man or woman that could resist
mine."</p>

<p>She noted with painful fascination the powerful
movements of his lean fingers as he spoke, for his
sinewy right hand, wrinkled and hideous, lay
stretched out on the table before him, and he clasped
and unclasped it unconsciously as he made his threat.</p>

<p>"I like you none the less for your spirit, ma'am.
'Fore God, it runs with your beauty. You are silent,"
he continued, staring at her with red-eyed, drunken
suspicion. "You do not answer?"</p>

<p>"My lord," cried Mercedes, "I know not what to
say."</p>

<p>"Say, 'Harry Morgan, I love you and I am
yours.'"</p>

<p>"There is another present, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"Where? Another? Who has dared&mdash;" roared
the buccaneer glaring about him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thy servant&mdash;the negro."</p>

<p>"Oh," he laughed, "he is nothing. Black Dog,
we call him. He is my slave, my shadow, my protection.
He is always by."</p>

<p>An idea had swiftly flashed into the young girl's
mind. If she could get rid of the slave she could
deal more easily with the master. She was tall,
strong, and Morgan, it appeared, was not in full possession
of his faculties or his strength from the liquor
he had imbibed.</p>

<p>"Still," she urged, "I do not like to be wooed in
the presence of another, even though he be a slave.
'Tis not a Spanish maiden's way, sir."</p>

<p>"Your will now, lady," said the buccaneer, with a
hideous attempt at gallantry, "is my law. Afterwards&mdash;'twill
be another matter. Out, Carib, but be
within call. Now, madam, we are alone. Speak you
the English tongue?"</p>

<p>The conversation had been carried on in Spanish
heretofore.</p>

<p>"Indifferently, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll teach it you. The lesson may as well
begin now. Say after me, 'Harry'&mdash;I permit that
though I am a belted knight of England, made so by
His Merry Majesty, King Charles, God rest him.
Drink to the repose of the king!" he cried, shoving
a cup across the table toward her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>Resisting a powerful temptation to throw it at him,
and divining that the stimulant might be of assistance
to her in the trying crisis in which she found herself,
the girl lifted the cup to her lips, bowed to him, and
swallowed a portion of the contents.</p>

<p>"Give it back to me!" he shouted. "You have
tasted it, I drain it. Now the lesson. Say after me,
'Harry Morgan'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry Morgan," gasped the girl.</p>

<p>"'I love thee.'"</p>

<p>With a swift inward prayer she uttered the lying
words.</p>

<p>"You have learned well, and art an apt pupil
indeed," he cried, leering upon her in approbation
and lustful desire&mdash;- his very gaze was pollution to
her. "D'ye know there are few women who can
resist me when I try to be agreeable? Harry Morgan's
way!" he laughed again. "There be some
that I have won and many I have forced. None like
you. So you love me? Scuttle me, I thought so.
Ben Hornigold was right. Woo a woman, let her be
clipped willingly in arms&mdash;yet there's a pleasure in
breaking in the jades, after all. Still, I'm glad that
you are in a better mood and have forgot that cursed
Spaniard rotting in the dungeons below, in favor of
a better man, Harry&mdash;no, I'll say, Sir Henry&mdash;Mor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>gan&mdash;on
this occasion, at your service," he cried,
rising again and bowing to her as before.</p>

<p>She looked desperately at the clock. The hour was
close at hand. So great was the strain under which
she was laboring that she felt she could not continue
five minutes longer. Would Alvarado never come?
Would anybody come? She sat motionless and white
as marble, while the chieftain stared at her in the
pauses of his monologue.</p>

<p>"Now, madam, since you have spoke the words
perhaps you will further wipe out the recollection of
this caress&mdash;" he pointed to his cheek again. "Curse
me!" he cried in sudden heat, "you are the only
human being that ever struck Harry Morgan on the
face and lived to see the mark. I'd thought to wait
until to-morrow and fetch some starveling priest to
play his mummery, but why do so? We are alone
here&mdash;together. There is none to disturb us. Black
Dog watches. You love me, do you not?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" she gasped out, brokenly praying for
strength, and fighting for time.</p>

<p>"You said it once, that's enough. Come, lady,
let's have happiness while we may. Seal the bargain
and kiss away the blows."</p>

<p>He came around the table and approached her.
Notwithstanding the quantity of liquor he had taken
he was physically master of himself, she noticed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
a sinking heart. As he drew near, she sprang to her
feet also and backed away from him, throwing out
her left hand to ward him off, at the same time
thrusting her right hand into her bosom.</p>

<p>"Not now," she cried, finding voice and word in
the imminence of the peril. "Oh, for God's
sake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tis useless to call on God in Harry Morgan's
presence, mistress, for he is the only God that hears.
Come and kiss me, thou black beauty&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, for Christ's sake!" cried the girl.
"I am a Christian&mdash;I must have a priest&mdash;not now&mdash;to-morrow!"</p>

<p>She was backed against the wall and could go no
further.</p>

<p>"To-night," chuckled the buccaneer.</p>

<p>He was right upon her now. She thrust him, unsuspicious
and unprepared, violently from her,
whipped out the dagger that Hornigold had given
her, and faced him boldly.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock and no one had yet appeared.
The struck hour reverberated through the empty
room. Would Alvarado never come? Had it not
been that she hoped for him she would have driven
the tiny weapon into her heart at once, but for his
sake she would wait a little longer.</p>

<p>"Nay, come no nearer!" she cried resolutely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
"If you do, you will take a dead woman in your
arms. Back, I say!" menacing herself with the
point.</p>

<p>And the man noted that the hand holding the
weapon did not tremble in the least.</p>

<p>"Thinkest thou that I could love such a man as
thou?" she retorted, trembling with indignation, all
the loathing and contempt she had striven to repress
finding vent in her voice. "I'd rather be torn limb
from limb than feel even the touch of thy polluting
hand!"</p>

<p>"Death and fury!" shouted Morgan, struggling
between rage and mortification, "thou hast lied to
me then?"</p>

<p>"A thousand times&mdash;yes! Had I a whip I'd
mark you again. Come within reach and I will drive
the weapon home!"</p>

<p>She lifted it high in the air and shook it in defiance
as she spoke.</p>

<p>It was a frightful imprudence, for which she paid
dearly, however, for the hangings parted and Carib,
who had heard what had gone on, entered the room&mdash;indeed,
the voices of the man and woman filled
with passion fairly rang through the hall. His
quick eye took in the situation at once. He carried
at his belt a long, heavy knife. Without saying a
word, he pulled it out and threw it with a skill born<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
of long practice, which made him a master at the
game, fairly at the woman's uplifted hand. Before
either Morgan or Mercedes were aware of his presence
they heard the whistle of the heavy blade
through the air. At the same moment the missile
struck the blade of the dagger close to the palm of
the woman and dashed it from her hand. Both
weapons rebounded from the wall from the violence
of the blow and fell at Morgan's feet.</p>

<p>Mercedes was helpless.</p>

<p>"Well done, Carib!" cried Morgan exultantly.
"Never has that old trick of thine served me better.
Now, you she-devil&mdash;I have you in my power. Didst
prefer death to Harry Morgan? Thou shalt have it,
and thy lover, too. I'll tear him limb from limb and
in thy presence, too, but not until after&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, God! oh, God!" shrieked Mercedes, flattening
herself against the wall, shrinking from him
with wide outstretched arms as he approached her.
"Mercy!"</p>

<p>"I know not that word. Wouldst cozen me?
Hast another weapon in thy bodice? I'll look."</p>

<p>Before she could prevent him he seized her dress
at the collar with both hands and, in spite of her
efforts, by a violent wrench tore it open.</p>

<p>"No weapon there," he cried. "Ha! That
brings at last the color to your pale cheek!" he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
added, as the rich red crimsoned the ivory of her
neck and cheek at this outrage.</p>

<p>"Help, help!" she screamed. Her voice rang
high through the apartment with indignant and terrified
appeal.</p>

<p>"Call again," laughed Morgan.</p>

<p>"Kill me, kill me!" she begged.</p>

<p>"Nay, you must live to love me! Ho! ho!" he
answered, taking her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Mercy! Help!" she cried in frenzy, all the
woman in her in arms against the outrage, though
she knew her appeal was vain, when, wonder of
wonders&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I heard a lady's voice," broke upon her ears
from the other end of the room.</p>

<p>"De Lussan!" roared Morgan, releasing her and
turning toward the intruder. "Here's no place
for you. How came you here? I'd chosen this room
for myself, I wish to be private. Out of it, and
thank me for your life!"</p>

<p>"I know not why you should have Donna de
Lara against her will, and when better men are
here," answered the Frenchman, staring with bold,
cruel glances at her, beautiful in her disarray, "and
if you keep her you must fight for her. Mademoiselle,"
he continued, baring his sword gracefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 320-322]</a></span>
and saluting her, "will you have me for your
champion?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Hast another weapon in thy bodice?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>His air was as gallant as if he had been a gentleman
and bound in honor to rescue a lady in dire
peril of life and honor, instead of another ruffian
inflamed by her beauty and desirous to possess her
himself.</p>

<p>"Save me! Save me," she cried, "from this
man!"</p>

<p>She did not realize the meaning of de Lussan's
words, she only saw a deliverer for the present. It
was ten minutes past the hour now. She welcomed
any respite; her lover might come at any moment.</p>

<p>"I will fight the both of you for her," cried the
Frenchman; "you, Black Dog, and you, Master
Morgan. Draw, unless you are a coward."</p>

<p>"I ought to have you hanged, you mutinous
hound!" shouted Morgan, "and hanged you shall be,
but not until I have proved myself your master with
the sword, as in all other things. Watch the woman,
Carib, and keep out of this fray. Lay hand on her
at your peril! Remember, she is mine."</p>

<p>"Or it may be mine," answered de Lussan, as
Morgan dashed at him.</p>

<p>They engaged without hesitation and the room
was filled with the sound of ringing, grating steel.
First pulling the pins from her glorious hair, Mer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>cedes
shook it down around her bare shoulders, and
then stood, fascinated, watching the fencers. She
could make no movement from the wall as the negro
stood at her arm. For a space neither of the fighters
had any advantage. De Lussan's skill was marvelous,
but the chief buccaneer was more than his
match. Presently the strength and capacity of the
older and more experienced swordsman began to
give him a slight advantage. Hard pressed, the
Frenchman, still keeping an inexorable guard, slowly
retreated up the room.</p>

<p>Both men had been so intensely occupied with the
fierce play that they had not heard the sound of
many feet outside, a sudden tumult in the street.
The keen ear of the half-breed, however, detected
that something was wrong.</p>

<p>"Master," he cried, "some one comes. I hear
shouts in the night air. A shot! Shrieks&mdash;groans!
There! The clash of arms! Lower your weapons,
sirs!" he cried again, as Spanish war cries filled the
air. "We are betrayed; the enemy is on us!"</p>

<p>Instantly Morgan and de Lussan broke away from
each other.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," cried the buccaneer captain.</p>

<p>"As you will," returned the other.</p>

<p>But now, Mercedes, staking all upon her hope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
lifted her voice, and with tremendous power begot
by fear and hope sent ringing through the air that
name which to her meant salvation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alvarado! Alvarado!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">HOW CAPTAIN ALVARADO CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS, FOUND
THE VICEROY, AND PLACED HIS LIFE IN HIS MASTER'S
HANDS</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">

</div>

<p>he highway between La Guayra and
Venezuela was exceedingly rough and
difficult, and at best barely practicable
for the stoutest wagons. The road
wound around the mountains for a distance of perhaps
twenty-five miles, although as the crow flies it
was not more than five miles between the two cities.
Between them, however, the tremendous ridge of
mountains rose to a height of nearly ten thousand
feet. Starting from the very level of the sea, the
road crossed the divide through a depression at an
altitude of about six thousand feet and descended
thence some three thousand feet to the valley in
which lay Caracas.</p>

<p>This was the road over which Alvarado and Mercedes
had come and on the lower end of which they
had been captured. It was now barred for the young
soldier by the detachment of buccaneers under young
Teach and L'Ollonois, who were instructed to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the pass where the road crossed through, or over, the
mountains. Owing to the configuration of the pass,
that fifty could hold it against a thousand. It was
not probable that news of the sack of La Guayra
would reach Caracas before Morgan descended upon
it, but to prevent the possibility, or to check any
movement of troops toward the shore, it was necessary
to hold that road. The man who held it was in
position to protect or strike either city at will. It
was, in fact, the key to the position.</p>

<p>Morgan, of course, counted upon surprising the
unfortified capital as he had the seaport town. It
was the boast of the Spaniards that they needed no
walls about Caracas, since nature had provided them
with the mighty rampart of the mountain range,
which could not be surmounted save in that one place.
With that one place in the buccaneer's possession,
Caracas could only rely upon the number and valor
of her defenders. To Morgan's onslaught could
only be opposed a rampart of blades and hearts.
Had there been a state of war in existence it is probable
that the Viceroy would have fortified and garrisoned
the pass, but under present conditions nothing
had been done. As soon as a messenger from
Teach informed Morgan that the pass had been
occupied and that all seemed quiet in Caracas, a
fact which had been learned by some bold scouting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
on the farther side of the mountain, he was perfectly
easy as to the work of the morrow. He would
fall upon the unwalled town at night and carry
everything by a <i>coup de main</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Spaniards in this instance, it
happened that there was another way of access to
the valley of Caracas from La Guayra. Directly up
and over the mountain there ran a narrow and difficult
trail, known first to the savages and afterwards
to wandering smugglers or masterless outlaws.
Originally, and until the Spaniards made the wagon
road, it had been the only way of communication
between the two towns. But the path was so difficult
and so dangerous that it had long since been
abandoned, even by the classes which had first discovered
and traveled it. These vagabonds had formerly
kept it in such a state of repair that it was
fairly passable, but no work had been done on it for
nearly one hundred years. Indeed, in some places,
the way had been designedly obliterated by the
Spanish Government about a century since, after
one of the most daring exploits that ever took place
in the new world.</p>

<p>Ninety years before this incursion by the buccaneers,
a bold English naval officer, Sir Amyas
Preston, after seizing La Guayra, had captured Caracas
by means of this path. The Spaniards, ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>prised
of his descent upon their coasts, had fortified
the mountain pass but had neglected this mountain
trail, as a thing impracticable for any force. Preston,
however, adroitly concealing his movements,
had actually forced his men to ascend the trail. The
ancient chroniclers tell of the terrific nature of the
climb, how the exhausted and frightened English
sailors dropped upon the rocks, appalled by their
dangers and worn out by their hardships, how Preston
and his officers forced them up at the point of
the sword until finally they gained the crest and
descended into the valley. They found the town unprotected,
for all its defenders were in the pass,
seized it, held it for ransom, then, sallying forth,
took the surprised Spanish troops in the pass in the
rear and swept them away.</p>

<p>After this exploit some desultory efforts had been
made by the Spaniards to render the trail still more
impracticable with such success as has been stated,
and it gradually fell into entire disuse. By nearly
all the inhabitants its very existence had been forgotten.</p>

<p>It was this trail that Alvarado determined to
ascend. The difficulties in his way, even under the
most favorable circumstances, might well have appalled
the stoutest-hearted mountaineer. In the
darkness they would be increased a thousand-fold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
He had not done a great deal of mountain climbing,
although every one who lived in Venezuela was
more or less familiar with the practice; but he was
possessed of a cool head, an unshakable nerve, a
resolute determination, and unbounded strength,
which now stood him in good stead. And he had
back of him, to urge him, every incentive in the
shape of love and duty that could move humanity to
godlike deed.</p>

<p>Along the base of the mountain the trail was not
difficult although it was pitch-dark under the trees
which, except where the mighty cliffs rose sheer in
the air like huge buttresses of the range, covered
the mountains for the whole expanse of their great
altitude, therefore he made his way upward without
trouble or accident at first. The moon's rays could
not pierce the density of the tropic foliage, of course,
but Alvarado was very familiar with this easier portion
of the way, for he had often traversed it on
hunting expeditions, and he made good progress for
several hours in spite of the obscurity.</p>

<p>It had been long past midnight when he started,
and it was not until daybreak that he passed above
the familiar and not untrodden way and entered
upon the most perilous part of his journey. The
gray dawn revealed to him the appalling dangers he
must face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes clinging with iron grasp to pinnacles
of rock, he swung himself along the side of some
terrific precipice, where the slightest misstep meant
a rush into eternity upon the rocks a thousand feet
below. Sometimes he had to spring far across great
gorges in the mountains that had once been bridged
by mighty trunks of trees, long since moldered away.
Sometimes there was nothing for him to do but to
scramble down the steep sides of some dark ca&ntilde;on
and force himself through cold torrential mountain
streams that almost swept him from his feet. Again
his path lay over cliffs green with moss and wet with
spray, which afforded most precarious support to his
grasping hands or slipping feet. Sometimes he had
to force a way through thick tropic undergrowth
that tore his clothing into rags.</p>

<p>Had he undertaken the ascent in a mere spirit of
adventure he would have turned back long since
from the dangers he met and surmounted with such
hardship and difficulty; but he was sustained by the
thought of the dreadful peril of the woman he loved,
the remembrance of the sufferings of the hapless
townspeople, and a consuming desire for revenge
upon the man who had wrought this ruin on the
shore. With the pale, beautiful face of Mercedes
to lead him, and by contrast the hateful, cruel countenance
of Morgan to force him, ever before his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
vision, the man plunged upward with unnatural
strength, braving dangers, taking chances, doing the
impossible&mdash;and Providence watched over him.</p>

<p>It was perhaps nine o'clock in the morning when
he reached the summit&mdash;breathless, exhausted, unhelmed,
weaponless, coatless, in rags; torn, bruised,
bleeding, but unharmed&mdash;and looked down on the
white city of Caracas set in its verdant environment
like a handful of pearls in a goblet of emerald. He
had wondered if he would be in time to intercept the
Viceroy, and his strained heart leaped in his tired
breast when he saw, a few miles beyond the town
on the road winding toward the Orinoco country, a
body of men. The sunlight blazing from polished
helms or pointed lance tips proclaimed that they
were soldiers. He would be in time, thank God!</p>

<p>With renewed vigor, he scrambled down the side
of the mountain&mdash;and this descent fortunately happened
to be gentle and easy&mdash;and running with
headlong speed, he soon drew near the gate of the
palace. He dashed into it with reckless haste, indifferent
to the protests of the guard, who did not at
first recognize in the tattered, bloody, wounded,
soiled specimen of humanity his gay and gallant
commander. He made himself known at once, and
was confirmed in his surmise that the Viceroy had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 332-334]</a></span>
set forth with his troops early in the morning and
was still in reaching distance on the road.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">

<span class="caption">... he reached the summit&mdash;breathless, exhausted,

</div>

<p>Directing the best horse in the stables to be
brought to him, after snatching a hasty meal while
it was being saddled, and not even taking time to
re-clothe himself, he mounted and galloped after.
An hour later he burst through the ranks of the little
army and reined in his horse before the astonished
Viceroy, who did not recognize in this sorry cavalier
his favorite officer, and stern words of reproof for
the unceremonious interruption of the horseman
broke from his lips until they were checked by the
first word from the young captain.</p>

<p>"The buccaneers have taken La Guayra and
sacked it!" gasped Alvarado hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Alvarado!" cried the Viceroy, recognizing him
as he spoke. "Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Would God I were, my lord."</p>

<p>"The buccaneers?"</p>

<p>"Morgan&mdash;all Spain hates him with reason&mdash;led
them!"</p>

<p>"Morgan! That accursed scourge again in arms?
Impossible! I don't understand!"</p>

<p>"The very same! 'Tis true! 'tis true! Oh, your
Excellency&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And my daughter&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>"A prisoner! For God's love turn back the
men!"</p>

<p>"Instantly!" cried the Viceroy.</p>

<p>He was burning with anxiety to hear more, but
he was too good a soldier to hesitate as to the first
thing to be done. Raising himself in his stirrups he
gave a few sharp commands and the little army,
which had halted when he had, faced about and
began the return march to Caracas at full speed.
As soon as their man&oelig;uvres had been completed and
they moved off, the Viceroy, who rode at the head
with Alvarado and the gentlemen of his suite, broke
into anxious questioning.</p>

<p>"Now, Captain, but that thou art a skilled soldier
I could not believe thy tale."</p>

<p>"My lord, I swear it is true!"</p>

<p>"And you left Donna Mercedes a prisoner?" interrupted
de Tobar, who had been consumed with
anxiety even greater than that of the Viceroy.</p>

<p>"Alas, 'tis so."</p>

<p>"How can that be when you are free, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"Let me question my own officer, de Tobar,"
resumed the Viceroy peremptorily, "and silence, all,
else we learn nothing. Now, Alvarado. What is
this strange tale of thine?"</p>

<p>"My lord, after we left you yesterday morning we
made the passage safely down the mountain. Toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
evening as we approached La Guayra, just before the
point where the road turns into the strand, we were
set upon by men in ambush. The soldiers and attendants
were without exception slain. Although I
fought and beat down one or two of our assailants,
they struck me to the earth and took me alive. The
two ladies and I alone escaped. No indignity was
offered them. I was bound and we were led along
the road to a camp. There appeared to be some
three hundred and fifty men under the leadership
of a man who claimed to be Sir Henry Morgan,
sometime pirate and robber, later Vice-Governor of
Jamaica, now, as I gathered, in rebellion against
his king and in arms against us. They captured
the plate galleon with lading from Porto Bello and
Peru, and were wrecked on this coast to the westward
of La Guayra. They had determined upon the
capture of that town, whence they expected to move
on Caracas."</p>

<p>"And Mercedes?" again interrupted the impetuous
and impassioned de Tobar.</p>

<p>"Let him tell his tale!" commanded the Viceroy,
sternly. "It behooves us, gentlemen, to think first
of the cities of our King."</p>

<p>"They had captured a band of holy nuns and
priests. These were forced, especially the women,
by threats you can imagine, to plant scaling ladders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
against the walls, and, although the troops made a
brave defense, the buccaneers mastered them. They
carried the place by storm and sacked it. When I
left it was burning in several places and turned into
a hell."</p>

<p>"My God!" ejaculated the old man, amid the
cries and oaths of his fierce, infuriated men. "And
now tell me about Mercedes."</p>

<p>"Morgan&mdash;who met her, you remember, when we
stopped at Jamaica on our return from Madrid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"He is in love with her. He wanted to make her
his wife. Therefore he kept her from the soldiery."</p>

<p>In his eagerness the Viceroy reined in his horse,
and the officers and men, even the soldiers, stopped
also and crowded around the narrator.</p>

<p>"Did he&mdash;did he&mdash;O Holy Mother have pity
upon me!" groaned the Viceroy.</p>

<p>"He did her no violence save to kiss her, while
I was by."</p>

<p>"And you suffered it!" shouted de Tobar, beside
himself with rage.</p>

<p>"What did she then?" asked the old man, waving
his hand for silence.</p>

<p>"She struck him in the face again and again with
her riding-whip. I was bound, se&ntilde;ors. I broke my
bonds, struck down one of the guards, wrested a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
sword from another, and sprang to defend her. But
they overpowered me. Indeed, they seized the lady
and swore to kill her unless I dropped my weapon."</p>

<p>"Death," cried de Lara, "would have been perhaps
a fitting end for her. What more?"</p>

<p>"We were conveyed into the city after the sack.
He insulted her again with his compliments and
propositions. He sent a slave to fetch her, but,
bound as I was, I sprang upon him and beat him
down."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then one of his men, an ancient, one-eyed
sailor, interfered and bade him look to the town, else
it would be burned over his head, and urged him to
secure the pass. In this exigency the pirate desisted
from his plan against the lady. He sent Donna
Mercedes to a dungeon, me to another."</p>

<p>"How came you here, sir, and alone?" asked de
Tobar, again interrupting, and this time the Viceroy,
pitying the agony of the lover, permitted the question.
"Did you, a Spanish officer, leave the lady
defenseless amid those human tigers?"</p>

<p>"There was nothing else to do, Don Felipe. The
sailor who interfered, he set me free. I did refuse
to leave without the se&ntilde;orita. He told me I must
go without her or not at all. He promised to protect
her honor or to kill her&mdash;at least to furnish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
her with a weapon. To go, to reach you, your Excellency,
was the only chance for her. Going, I
might save her; staying, I could only die."</p>

<p>"You did rightly. I commend you," answered
the veteran. "Go on."</p>

<p>"My lord, I thank you. The way over the road
was barred by the party that had seized the pass."</p>

<p>"And how came you?"</p>

<p>"Straight over the mountain, sir."</p>

<p>"What! The Indian trail? The English way?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"At ten to-night, the sailor who released me will
open the city gate, the west gate, beneath the
shadow of the cliffs&mdash;we must be there!"</p>

<p>"But how? Can we take the pass? It is strongly
held, you say."</p>

<p>"My lord, give me fifty brave men who will
volunteer to follow me. I will lead them back over
the trail and we will get to the rear of the men holding
the pass. Do you make a feint at engaging them
in force in front and when their attention is distracted
elsewhere we will fall on and drive them into
your arms. By this means we open the way. Then
we will post down the mountains with speed and may
arrive in time. Nay, we must arrive in time! Hornigold,
the sailor, would guarantee nothing beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
to-night. The buccaneers are drunk with liquor;
tired out with slaughter. They will suspect nothing.
We can master the whole three hundred and
fifty of them with five score men."</p>

<p>"Alvarado," cried the Viceroy, "thou hast done
well. I thank thee. Let us but rescue my daughter
and defeat these buccaneers and thou mayest ask
anything at my hands&mdash;saving one thing. Gentlemen
and soldiers, you have heard the plan of the
young captain. Who will volunteer to go over the
mountains with him?"</p>

<p>Brandishing their swords and shouting with loud
acclaim the great body of troopers pressed forward
to the service. Alvarado, who knew them all,
rapidly selected the requisite number, and they fell
in advance of the others. Over them the young captain
placed his friend de Tobar as his second in command.</p>

<p>"'Tis bravely done!" cried the Viceroy. "Now
prick forward to the city, all. We'll refresh ourselves
in view of the arduous work before us and
then make our further dispositions."</p>

<p>The streets of Caracas were soon full of armed
men preparing for their venture. As soon as the
plight of La Guayra and the Viceroy's daughter
became known there was scarcely a civilian, even,
who did not offer himself for the rescue. The Vice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>roy,
however, would take only mounted men, and of
these only tried soldiers. Alvarado, whom excitement
and emotion kept from realizing his fatigue,
was provided with fresh apparel, after which he
requested a private audience for a moment or two
with the Viceroy, and together they repaired to the
little cabinet which had been the scene of the happenings
the night before.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," began the young man, slowly,
painfully, "I could not wait even the hoped-for
happy issue of our plans to place my sword and my
life in your hands."</p>

<p>"What have you done?" asked the old man, instantly
perceiving the seriousness of the situation
from the anguish in his officer's look and voice.</p>

<p>"I have broken my word&mdash;forfeited my life."</p>

<p>"Proceed."</p>

<p>"I love the Donna Mercedes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You promised to say nothing&mdash;to do nothing."</p>

<p>"That promise I did not keep."</p>

<p>"Explain."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to explain. I was weak&mdash;it
was beyond my strength. I offer no excuse."</p>

<p>"You urge nothing in extenuation?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"'Twas deliberately done?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not that; but I&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>"S'death! What did you?"</p>

<p>"I told her that I loved her, again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shame! Shame!"</p>

<p>"I took her into my arms once more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou double traitor! And she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lord, condemn her not. She is young&mdash;a
woman."</p>

<p>"I do not consider Captain Alvarado, a dishonored
soldier, my proper mentor. I shall know
how to treat my daughter. What more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more. We abandoned ourselves to our
dream, and at the first possible moment I am come
to tell you all&mdash;to submit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hast no plea to urge?" persisted the old man.</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"But your reason? By God's death, why do you
tell me these things? If thou art base enough to
fall, why not base enough to conceal?"</p>

<p>"I could not do so, your Excellency. I am not
master of myself when she is by&mdash;'tis only when
away from her I see things in their proper light.
She blinds me. No, sir," cried the unhappy Alvarado,
seeing a look of contempt on the grim face
of the old general, "I do not urge this in defense,
but you wanted explanation."</p>

<p>"Nothing can explain the falsehood of a gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>man,
the betrayal of a friend, the treachery of a
soldier."</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;hence I am here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have estimated you too highly," went
on the old man musingly. "I had hoped you were
gentle&mdash;but base blood must run in your veins."</p>

<p>"It may be," answered the young man brokenly,
and then he added, as one detail not yet told, "I
have found my mother, sir."</p>

<p>"Thy mother? What is her condition?" cried
the Viceroy, in curious and interested surprise that
made him forget his wrath and contempt for the
moment.</p>

<p>"She was an abbess of our Holy Church. She
died upon the sands of La Guayra by her own hand
rather than surrender her honor or lend aid to the
sack of the town."</p>

<p>"That was noble," interrupted the old de Lara.
"I may be mistaken after all. Yet 'twere well she
died, for she will not see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused significantly.</p>

<p>"My shame?" asked Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Thy death, se&ntilde;or, for what you have done. No
other punishment is meet. Did Donna Mercedes
send any message to me?"</p>

<p>Alvarado could not trust himself to speak. He
bowed deeply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>The young man stood silent before him.</p>

<p>"Well, I will learn from her own lips if she be
alive when we come to the city. I doubt not it will
excuse thee."</p>

<p>"I seek not to shelter myself behind a woman."</p>

<p>"That's well," said the old man. "But now, what
is to be done with thee?"</p>

<p>"My lord, give me a chance, not to live, but to
die honestly. Let me play my part this day as
becomes a man, and when Donna Mercedes is
restored to your arms&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou wilt plead for life?"</p>

<p>"Nay, as God hears me, I will not live dishonored.
Life is naught to me without the lady. I swear to
thee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have given me your word before, sir,"
said the old man sternly.</p>

<p>"On this cross&mdash;it was my mother's," he pulled
from his doublet the silver crucifix and held it up.
"I will yield my life into your hands without question
then, and acclaim before the world that you are
justified in taking it. Believe me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou didst betray me once."</p>

<p>"But not this time. Before God&mdash;by Christ, His
Mother, by my own mother, dead upon the sands, by
all that I have hoped for, by my salvation, I swear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
if I survive the day I will go gladly to my death at
your command!"</p>

<p>"I will trust you once more, thus far. Say
naught of this to any one. Leave me!"</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," cried the young man, kneeling
before him, "may God reward you!"</p>

<p>He strove to take the hand of the old man, but
the latter drew it away.</p>

<p>"Even the touch of forsworn lips is degradation.
You have your orders. Go!"</p>

<p>Alvarado buried his face in his hands, groaned
bitterly, and turned away without another word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">WHEREIN MASTER TEACH, THE PIRATE, DIES BETTER THAN
HE LIVED</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:5%;  margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0em; margin-top: 0em;">

</div>

<p>t was nearing eleven o'clock in the morning
when, after a hurried conference in the
patio with the Viceroy and the others,
Alvarado and de Tobar marched out with
their fifty men. They
had discarded all superfluous
clothing; they
were unarmored and
carried no weapons but
swords and pistols. In
view of the hard climb
before them and the
haste that was required,
they wished to be burdened
as lightly as possible.
Their horses were brought along in the train
of the Viceroy's party which moved out upon the
open road to the pass at the same time. These last
went forward with great ostentation, the forlorn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
hope secretly, lest some from the buccaneers might
be watching.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<img src="images/024.jpg" style="width: 100%" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The fifty volunteers were to ascend the mountain
with all speed, make their way along the crest as best
they could, until they came within striking distance
of the camp of the pirates. Then they were to conceal
themselves in the woods there and when the
Viceroy made a feigned attack with the main body
of his troops from the other side of the mountain,
they were to leave their hiding-place and fall furiously
upon the rear of the party. Fortunately, they
were not required to ascend such a path as that Alvarado
had traversed on the other side, for there
were not fifty men in all Venezuela who could have
performed that tremendous feat of mountaineering.
The way to the summit of the range and thence to
the pass was difficult, but not impossible, and they
succeeded after an hour or two of hard climbing in
reaching their appointed station, where they concealed
themselves in the woods, unobserved by
Teach's men.</p>

<p>The Viceroy carried out his part of the programme
with the promptness of a soldier. Alvarado's
men had scarcely settled themselves in the
thick undergrowth beneath the trees whence they
could overlook the buccaneers in camp on the road
below them, before a shot from the pirate sentry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
who had been posted toward Caracas called the fierce
marauders to arms. They ran to the rude barricade
they had erected covering the pass and made preparation
for battle. Soon the wood was ringing with
shouts and cries and the sound of musketry.</p>

<p>Although Teach was a natural soldier and L'Ollonois
an experienced and prudent commander, they
took no precaution whatever to cover their rear, for
such a thing as an assault from that direction was
not even dreamed of.</p>

<p>Alvarado and de Tobar, therefore, led their men
forward without the slightest opposition. Even the
noise they made crashing through the undergrowth
was lost in the sound of the battle, and attracted no
attention from the enemy. It was not until they
burst out into the open road and charged forward,
cheering madly, that the buccaneers realized their
danger. Some of them faced about, only to be met
by a murderous discharge from the pistols of the
forlorn hope, and the next moment the Spaniards
were upon them. The party holding the pass were
the picked men, veterans, among the marauders.
They met the onset with tremendous courage and
crossed blades in the smoke like men, but at the same
instant the advance guard of the main army sprang
at the barricade and assaulted them vigorously from
the other side. The odds were too much for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
buccaneers, and after a wild m&ecirc;l&eacute;e in which they lost
heavily, the survivors gave ground.</p>

<p>The road immediately below the pass opened on a
little plateau, back of which rose a precipitous wall
of rock. Thither such of the buccaneers as were left
alive hastily retreated. There were perhaps a dozen
men able to use their weapons; among them Teach
was the only officer. L'Ollonois had been cut down
by de Tobar in the first charge. The Spaniards
burst through the pass and surrounded the buccaneers.
The firearms on both sides had all been
discharged, and in the excitement no one thought
of reloading; indeed, with the cumbersome and complicated
weapons then in vogue there was no time,
and the Spaniards, who had paid dearly for their
victory, so desperate had been the defence of the
pirates, were fain to finish this detachment in short
order.</p>

<p>"Yield!" cried Alvarado, as usual in the front
ranks of his own men. "You are hopelessly overmatched,"
pointing with dripping blade to his own
and the Viceroy's soldiers as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Shall we get good quarter?" called out Teach.</p>

<p>A splendid specimen he looked of an Englishman
at bay, in spite of his wicked calling, standing with
his back against the towering rock, his bare and
bloody sword extended menacingly before him, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
bright sunlight blazing upon his sunny hair, his blue
eyes sparkling with battle-lust and determined courage.
Quite the best of the pirates, he!</p>

<p>"You shall be hung like the dogs you are,"
answered Alvarado sternly.</p>

<p>"We'd rather die sword in hand, eh, lads?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay."</p>

<p>"Come on, then, se&ntilde;ors," laughed the Englishman
gallantly, saluting with his sword, "and see
how bravely we English can die when the game is
played and we have lost."</p>

<p>Though his cause was bad and his life also, his
courage was magnificent. Under other circumstances
it would have evoked the appreciation of Alvarado
and some consideration at his hands. Possibly
he might even have granted life to the man,
but memory of the sights of the night before in that
devastated town six thousand feet below their feet,
and the deadly peril of his sweetheart banished pity
from his soul. This man had been the right hand of
Morgan; he was, after the captain, the ablest man
among the buccaneers. He must die, and it would
be a mercy to kill him out of hand, anyway.</p>

<p>"Forward, gentlemen!" he cried, and instantly
the whole mass closed in on the pirates. Such a fight
as Teach and his men made was marvellous. For
each life the Spaniards took the pirates exacted a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
high price, but the odds were too great for any human
valor, however splendid, to withstand, and in a brief
space the last of the buccaneers lay dying on the hill.</p>

<p>Teach was game to the last. Pierced with a dozen
wounds, his sword broken to pieces, he lifted himself
on his elbow, and with a smile of defiance gasped
out the brave chorus of the song of the poet of
London town:</p>

<p>
"Though life now is pleasant and sweet to the sense,<br />
We'll be damnably mouldy a hundred years hence."<br />
</p>

<p>"Tell Morgan," he faltered, "we did not betray&mdash;faithful
to the end&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And so he died as he had lived.</p>

<p>"A brave man!" exclaimed de Tobar with some
feeling in his voice.</p>

<p>"But a black-hearted scoundrel, nevertheless,"
answered Alvarado sternly. "Had you seen him
last night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye have been successful, I see, gentlemen," cried
the Viceroy, riding up with the main body. "Where
is Alvarado?"</p>

<p>"I am here, your Excellency."</p>

<p>"You are yet alive, se&ntilde;or?"</p>

<p>"My work is not yet complete," answered the
soldier, "and I can not die until&mdash;I&mdash;Donna Mer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bring up the led horses," interrupted the Vice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>roy
curtly. "Mount these gentlemen. Let the chirurgeons
look to the Spanish wounded."</p>

<p>"And if there be any buccaneers yet alive?"
asked one of the officers.</p>

<p>"Toss them over the cliff," answered the Viceroy;
"throw the bodies of all the carrion over, living or
dead. They pollute the air. Form up, gentlemen!
We have fully twenty-five miles between us and the
town which we must reach at ten of the clock. 'Twill
be hard riding. Alvarado, assemble your men and
you and de Tobar lead the way, I will stay farther
back and keep the main body from scattering. We
have struck a brave blow first, and may God and St.
Jago defend us further. Forward!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE RECITAL OF HOW CAPTAIN ALVARADO AND DON FELIPE
DE TOBAR CAME TO THE RESCUE IN THE NICK OF TIME</p>

<p>ld Hornigold had kept his promise, and
Alvarado had kept his as well. It was
a few minutes before ten when the
first Spanish horsemen sprang from
their jaded steeds at the
end of the road. In that
wild race down the
mountains, Alvarado had
ridden first with de
Tobar ever by his side.
None had been able to
pass these two. The
Viceroy had fallen some
distance behind. For
one reason, he was an
old man, and the pace set by the lovers was killing.
For another and a better, as he had said, he thought
it desirable to stay somewhat in the rear to keep the
men closed up; but the pace even of the last and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
slowest had been a tremendous one. Sparing neither
themselves nor their horses, they had raced down
the perilous way. Some of them had gone over the
cliffs to instant destruction; others had been heavily
thrown by the stumbling horses. Some of the horses
had given out under the awful gallop and had fallen
exhausted, but when the riders were unhurt they
had joined the foot soldiers marching after the
troopers as fast they could.</p>

<p>Alvarado's soldierly instincts had caused him to
halt where the road opened upon the sand, for he
and de Tobar and the two or three who kept near
them could do nothing alone. They were forced to
wait until a sufficient force had assembled to begin
the attack. He would have been there before the
appointed time had it not been for this imperative
delay, which demonstrated his capacity more than
almost anything else could have done, for he was
burning to rush to the rescue of Mercedes.</p>

<p>Indeed, he had been compelled to restrain by force
the impetuous and undisciplined de Tobar, who
thought of nothing but the peril of the woman he
adored. There had been a fierce altercation between
the two young men before the latter could
be persuaded that Alvarado was right. Each
moment, however, added to the number of the party.
There was no great distance between the first and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
last, and after a wait of perhaps ten or fifteen minutes,
some one hundred and fifty horsemen were
assembled. The Viceroy had not come up with the
rest, but they were sure he would be along presently,
and Alvarado would wait no longer.</p>

<p>Bidding the men dismount lest they should be
observed on horseback, and stationing one to acquaint
the Viceroy with his plans, he divided his troop into
three companies, he and de Tobar taking command
of one and choosing the nearest fort as their objective
point. Captain Agramonte, a veteran soldier,
was directed to scour the town, and Lieutenant
Nu&ntilde;ez, another trusted officer, was ordered to master
the eastern fort on the other side. They were
directed to kill every man whom they saw at large in
the city, shooting or cutting down every man abroad
without hesitation, for Alvarado rightly divined that
all the inhabitants would be penned up in some
prison or other and that none would be on the streets
except the buccaneers. There were still enough
pirates in the city greatly to outnumber his force,
but many of them were drunk and all of them, the
Spaniard counted, would be unprepared. The advantage
of the surprise would be with his own men.
If he could hold them in play for twenty minutes
the Viceroy with another detachment would arrive,
and thereafter the end would be certain. They could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
take prisoners then and reserve them for torture
and death&mdash;some meet punishment for their crimes.</p>

<p>Those necessary preparations were made with the
greatest speed, the men were told off in their respective
companies, and then, keeping close under the
shadow of the cliff for fear of a possible watcher,
they started forward.</p>

<p>Since ten old Ben Hornigold had been hidden in
an arched recess of the gateway waiting their arrival.
He had thought, as the slow minutes dragged by,
that Alvarado had failed, and he began to contrive
some way by which he could account for his escape
to Morgan in the morning, when the captain would
ask to have him produced, but the arrival of the
Spaniards relieved his growing anxiety.</p>

<p>"Donna Mercedes?" asked Alvarado of the old
boatswain, as he entered the gate.</p>

<p>"Safe when I left her in the guardroom with
Morgan&mdash;and armed. If you would see her
alive&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This way&mdash;&mdash;" cried Alvarado, dashing madly
along the street toward the fort.</p>

<p>Every man had his weapons in hand, and the
little party had scarcely gone ten steps before they
met a buccaneer. He had been asleep when he
should have watched, and had just been awakened
by the sound of their approach. He opened his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
mouth to cry out, but Alvarado thrust his sword
through him before he could utter a sound. The
moonlight made the street as light as day, and before
they had gone twenty steps farther, turning the
corner, they came upon a little party of the pirates.
An immediate alarm was given by them. The
Spaniards brushed them aside by the impetuosity of
their onset, but on this occasion pistols were brought
in play. Screams and cries followed the shots, and
calls to arms rang through the town.</p>

<p>But by this time the other companies were in the
city, and they were making terrible havoc as they
ran to their appointed stations. The buccaneers
came pouring from the houses, most of them arms in
hand. It could not be denied that they were ready
men. But the three attacks simultaneously delivered
bewildered them. The streets in all directions
seemed full of foes. The advantage of the surprise
was with the Spanish. The pirates were without
leadership for the moment and ran aimlessly to and
fro, not knowing where to rally; yet little bands did
gather together instinctively, and these began to
make some headway against the Spanish soldiery.
Even the cowards fought desperately, for around
every neck was already the feel of a halter.</p>

<p>Alvarado and de Tobar soon found themselves
detached from their company. Indeed, as the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
progressed and the buccaneers began to perceive the
situation they put up a more and more stubborn and
successful opposition. They rallied in larger parties
and offered a stout resistance to the Spanish charges.
Disregarding their isolation, the two young officers
ran to the fort. Fortunately the way in that direction
was not barred. The solitary sentry at the gateway
attempted to check them, but they cut him
down in an instant. As they mounted the stair they
heard, above the shrieks and cries and shots of the
tumult that came blowing in the casement with the
night wind, the sound of a woman's screams.</p>

<p>"Mercedes!" cried de Tobar. "It is she!"</p>

<p>They bounded up the stairs, overthrowing one or
two startled men who would have intercepted them,
and darted to the guardroom. They tore the heavy
hangings aside and found themselves in a blaze of
light in the long apartment. Two men confronted
them. Back of the two, against the wall, in a piteous
state of disorder and terror, stood the woman they
both loved. In front of her, knife in hand, towered
the half-breed.</p>

<p>"Treason, treason!" shouted Morgan furiously.
"We are betrayed! At them, de Lussan!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the four men crossed swords. De
Tobar was not the master of the weapon that the
others were. After a few rapid parries and lunges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the Frenchman had the measure of his brave young
opponent. Then, with a laugh of evil intent, by a
clever play he beat down the Spaniard's guard, shattering
his weapon, and with a thrust as powerful as
it was skilful, he drove the blade up to the hilt in
poor de Tobar's bosom. The gallant but unfortunate
gentleman dropped his own sword as he fell, and
clasped his hands by a convulsive effort around the
blade of de Lussan. Such was the violence of his
grasp that he fairly hugged the sword to his breast,
and when he fell backward upon the point the blade
snapped. He was done for.</p>

<p>Morgan and Alvarado, on the other hand, were
more equally matched. Neither had gained an advantage,
although both fought with energy and fury.
Alvarado was silent, but Morgan made the air ring
with shouts and cries for his men. As the swords
clashed, Carib raised his hand to fling his knife at
Alvarado, but, just as the weapon left his fingers,
Mercedes threw herself upon him. The whizzing
blade went wild. With a savage oath he seized a
pistol and ran toward the Spaniard, who was at last
getting the better of the Captain. A cry from Mercedes
warned Alvarado of this new danger. Disengaging
suddenly, he found himself at sword's
point with de Lussan, who had withdrawn his broken
weapon from de Tobar's body and was menacing him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
with it. With three opponents before him he backed
up against the wall and at last gave tongue.</p>

<p>"To me!" he cried loudly, hoping some of his
men were within call. "Alvarado!"</p>

<p>As he spoke Morgan closed with him once more,
shouting:</p>

<p>"On him, de Lussan! Let him have it, Black
Dog! We've disposed of one!"</p>

<p>As the blades crossed again, the desperate Spaniard,
who was a swordsman of swordsmen, put forth
all his power. There was a quick interchange of
thrust and parry, and the weapon went whirling
from the hand of the chief buccaneer. Quick as
thought Alvarado shortened his arm and drove home
the stroke. Morgan's life trembled in the balance.
The maroon, however, who had been seeking a
chance to fire, threw himself between the two men
and received the force of the thrust full in the heart.
His pistol was discharged harmlessly. He fell dead
at his master's feet without even a groan. No more
would Black Dog watch behind the old man's chair.
He had been faithful to his hideous leader and his
hideous creed. Before Alvarado could recover his
guard, de Lussan struck him with his broken sword.
The blow was parried by arm and dagger, but the
force of it sent the Spaniard reeling against the
wall. At the same instant Morgan seized a pistol and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
snapped it full in his face. The weapon missed fire,
but the buccaneer, clutching the barrel, beat him
down with a fierce blow.</p>

<p>"So much for these two," he roared. "Let's to
the street."</p>

<p>De Lussan seized Alvarado's sword, throwing
away his own. Morgan picked up his own blade
again, and the two ran from the room.</p>

<p>A stern fight was being waged in the square,
whither all the combatants had congregated, the buccaneers
driven there, the Spaniards following. The
disciplined valor and determination of the Spanish,
however, were slowly causing the buccaneers to give
ground. No Spanish soldiers that ever lived could
have defeated the old-time buccaneers, but these
were different, and their best men had been killed
with Teach and L'Ollonois. The opportune arrival
of Morgan and de Lussan, however, put heart in
their men. Under the direction of these two redoubtable
champions they began to make stouter
resistance.</p>

<p>The battle might have gone in their favor if, in
the very nick of time, the Viceroy himself and the
remainder of the troops had not come up. They had
not thought it necessary to come on foot since the
surprise had been effected, and the Viceroy rightly
divined they would have more advantage if mounted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Choosing the very freshest horses therefore, he had
put fifty of the best soldiers upon them and had led
them up on a gallop, bidding the others follow on
with speed. The fighting had gradually concentrated
before the church and in the eastern fort,
where Braziliano had his headquarters. The arrival
of the horsemen decided the day. Morgan and de
Lussan, fighting desperately in the front ranks with
splendid courage, were overridden. De Lussan was
wounded, fell, and was trampled to death by the
Spanish horsemen, and Morgan was taken prisoner,
alive and unharmed. When he saw that all was lost,
he had thrown himself upon the enemy, seeking a
death in the fight, which, by the Viceroy's orders,
was denied him. Many of the other buccaneers also
were captured alive; indeed, the Viceroy desired as
many of them saved as possible. He could punish a
living man in a way to make him feel something of
the torture he had inflicted, and for this reason
those who surrendered had been spared for the
present.</p>

<p>Indeed, after the capture of Morgan the remaining
buccaneers threw down their arms and begged
for mercy. They might as well have appealed to a
stone wall for that as to their Spanish captors. A
short shrift and a heavy punishment were promised
them in the morning. Meanwhile, after a brief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
struggle, the east fort was taken by assault, and
Braziliano was wounded and captured with most of
his men. The town was in the possession of the
Spanish at last. It was all over in a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>Instantly the streets were filled with a mob of
men, women, and children, whose lives had been
spared, bewildered by the sudden release from their
imminent peril and giving praise to God and the
Viceroy and his men. As soon as he could make
himself heard in the confusion de Lara inquired for
Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he cried. "And de Tobar?"</p>

<p>"My lord," answered one of the party, "we were
directed to take the west fort and those two cavaliers
were in the lead, but the pressure of the pirates was
so great that we were stopped and have not seen
them since. They were ahead of us."</p>

<p>"De Cordova," cried the old man to one of his
colonels, "take charge of the town. Keep the
women and children and inhabitants together where
they are for the present. Let your soldiery patrol
the streets and search every house from top to bottom.
Let no one of these ruffianly scoundrels escape.
Take them alive. We'll deal with them in the
morning. Fetch Morgan to the west fort after us.
Come, gentlemen, we shall find our comrades there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
and pray God the ladies have not yet&mdash;are still unharmed!"</p>

<p>A noble old soldier was de Lara. He had not
sought his daughter until he had performed his full
duty in taking the town.</p>

<p>The anteroom of the fort they found in a state of
wild confusion. The dead bodies of the sentry and
the others the two cavaliers had cut down on the
stairs were ruthlessly thrust aside, and the party of
gentlemen with the Viceroy in the lead poured into
the guardroom. There, on his back, was stretched
the hideous body of the half-breed where he had
fallen. There, farther away, the unfortunate de
Tobar lay, gasping for breath yet making no outcry.
He was leaning on his arm and staring across the
room, with anguish in his face not due to the wound
he had received but to a sight which broke his heart.</p>

<p>"Alas, de Tobar!" cried the Viceroy. "Where
is Mercedes?"</p>

<p>He followed the glance of the dying man. There
at the other side of the room lay a prostrate body,
and over it bent a moaning, sobbing figure. It was
Mercedes.</p>

<p>"Mercedes!" cried the Viceroy running toward
her. "Alvarado!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," he asked in a heartbreaking voice.
"Art thou&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"Safe yet and&mdash;well," answered the girl; "they
came in the very nick of time. Oh, Alvarado, Alvarado!"
she moaned.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," cried one of the officers, "Don Felipe
here is dying. He would speak with you."</p>

<p>Mercedes suffered herself to be led to where de
Tobar lay upon the floor. One of his comrades had
taken his head on his knee. The very seconds of his
life were numbered. Lovely in her grief Mercedes
knelt at his side, a great pity in her heart. The
Viceroy stepped close to him.</p>

<p>"I thank you, too," she said. "Poor Don Felipe,
he and you saved me, but at the expense of your
lives. Would God you could have been spared!"</p>

<p>"Nay," gasped the dying man, "thou lovest him.
I&mdash;watched thee. I heard thee call upon his name.
Thou wert not for me, and so I die willingly. He is
a noble gentleman. Would he might have won
thee!"</p>

<p>The man trembled with the violent effort it cost
him to speak. He gasped faintly and strove to smile.
By an impulse for which she was ever after grateful,
she bent her head, slipped her arm around his neck,
lifted him up, and kissed him. In spite of his death
agony, at that caress he smiled up at her.</p>

<p>"Now," he murmured, "I die happy&mdash;content&mdash;you
kissed&mdash;me&mdash;Jesu&mdash;Mercedes&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the end of as brave a lover, as true a cavalier
as ever drew sword or pledged hand in a
woman's cause.</p>

<p>"He is dead," said the officer.</p>

<p>"God rest his soul, a gallant gentleman," said the
Viceroy, taking off his hat, and his example was followed
by every one in the room.</p>

<p>"And Captain Alvarado?" said Mercedes, rising
to her feet and turning to the other figure.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," answered another of the officers, "he
lives."</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I thank Thee!"</p>

<p>"See&mdash;he moves!"</p>

<p>A little shudder crept through the figure of the
prostrate Captain, who had only been knocked senseless
by the fierce blow and was otherwise unhurt.</p>

<p>"His eyes are open! Water, quick!"</p>

<p>With skilled fingers begot by long practice the
cavalier cut the lacings of Alvarado's doublet and
gave him water, then a little wine. As the young
Captain returned to consciousness, once more the
officers crowded around him, the Viceroy in the
centre, Mercedes on her knees again.</p>

<p>"Mercedes," whispered the young Captain.
"Alive&mdash;unharmed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mercedes brokenly, "thanks to
God and thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"And de Tobar," generously asserted Alvarado.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, brave de Tobar! And the city&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is ours."</p>

<p>"And Morgan?"</p>

<p>"Here in my hands," said the Viceroy sternly.</p>

<p>"Thank God, thank God! And now, your Excellency,
my promise. I thought as I was stricken
down there would be no need for you to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou hast earned life, Alvarado, not death, and
thou shalt have it."</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ors," said Alvarado, whose faintness was
passing from him, "I broke my plighted word to the
Viceroy and Don Felipe de Tobar. I love this lady
and was false to my charge. Don Alvaro promised
me death for punishment, and I crave it. I care
not for life without&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And did he tell thee why he broke his word?"
asked Mercedes, taking his hands in her own and
looking up at her father. "It was my fault. I made
him. In despair I strove to throw myself over the
cliff on yonder mountain and he caught me in his
arms. With me in his arms&mdash;Which of you, my
lords," she said, throwing back her head with superb
pride, "would not have done the same? Don Felipe
de Tobar is dead. He was a gallant gentleman, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
I loved him not. My father, you will not part us
now?"</p>

<p>"No," said the old man, "I will not try. I care
not now what his birth or lineage, he hath shown
himself a man of noblest soul. You heard the wish
of de Tobar. It shall be so. This is the betrothal
of my daughter, gentlemen. Art satisfied, Captain?
She is noble enough, she hath lineage and race
enough for both of you. My interest with our royal
master will secure you that patent of nobility you
will adorn, for bravely have you won it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>hese noble and generous words of the
Viceroy put such heart into the young
Spanish soldier that, forgetting his
wounds and his weakness, he rose to his
feet. Indeed, the blow
that struck him down
had stunned him rather
than anything else, and
he would not have been
put out of the combat so
easily had it not been
that he was exhausted by
the hardships of those
two terrible days through
which he had just passed.
The terrific mountain climb, the wild ride, the fierce
battle, his consuming anxiety for the woman he loved&mdash;these
things had so wearied him that he had been
unequal to the struggle. The stimulants which had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
been administered to him by his loving friends had
been of great service also in reviving his strength,
and he faced the Viceroy, his hand in that of Mercedes,
with a flush of pleasure and pride upon his
face.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, it was the consciousness of having
won permission to marry the woman whom he
adored and who loved him with a passion that would
fain overmatch his own, were that possible, that so
quickly restored him to strength. With the realization
of what he had gained there came to him such
an access of vigor as amazed those who a few
moments before had thought him dead or dying.</p>

<p>"But for these poor people who have so suffered,
this, my lord," he exclaimed with eager gratitude
and happiness, "hath been a happy day for me. Last
night, sir, on the beach yonder, I found a mother.
A good sister, she, of Holy Church, who, rather than
carry the ladders which gave access to the town, with
the fearful alternative of dishonor as a penalty for
refusal, killed herself with her own hand. She died
not, praise God, before she had received absolution
from a brave priest, although the holy father paid
for his office with his life, for Morgan killed him.
To-night I find, by the blessing of God, the favor of
your Excellency and the kindness of the lady's heart&mdash;a
wife."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>He dropped upon his knees as he spoke and pressed
a long, passionate kiss upon the happy Mercedes'
extended hand.</p>

<p>"Lady," he said, looking up at her, his soul in
his eyes, his heart in his voice, "I shall strive to
make myself noble for thee, and all that I am, and
shall be, shall be laid at thy feet."</p>

<p>"I want not more than thyself, Se&ntilde;or Alvarado,"
answered the girl bravely before them all, her own
cheeks aglow with happy color. "You have enough
honor already. You satisfy me."</p>

<p>"Long life to Donna de Lara and Captain Alvarado!"
cried old Agramonte, lifting up his hand.
"The handsomest, the noblest, the bravest pair in
New Spain! May they be the happiest! Give me
leave, sir," added the veteran captain turning to the
Viceroy. "You have done well. Say I not true,
gentlemen? And as for the young captain, as he
is fit to stand with the best, it is meet that he should
win the heart of the loveliest. His mother he has
found. None may know his father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me be heard," growled a deep voice in broken
Spanish, as the one-eyed old sailor thrust himself
through the crowd.</p>

<p>"Hornigold, by hell!" screamed the bound buccaneer
captain, who had been a silent spectator of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
events from the background. "I missed you. Have
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boatswain, mindful of his safety, for in the
hurry and confusion of the attack any Spaniard
would have cut him down before he could explain,
had followed hard upon the heels of Alvarado and
de Tobar when they entered the fort and had concealed
himself in one of the inner rooms until he saw
a convenient opportunity for disclosing himself. He
had been a witness to all that had happened in the
hall, and he realized that the time had now come to
strike the first of the blows he had prepared against
his old captain. That in the striking, he wrecked
the life and happiness of those he had assisted for
his own selfish purpose mattered little to him. He
had so long brooded and thought upon one idea, so
planned and schemed to bring about one thing, that
a desire for revenge fairly obsessed him.</p>

<p>As soon as he appeared from behind the hangings
where he had remained in hiding, it was evident to
every one that he was a buccaneer. Swords were out
in an instant.</p>

<p>"What's this?" cried the Viceroy in great surprise.
"Another pirate free and unbound? Seize
him!"</p>

<p>Three or four of the men made a rush toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
old buccaneer, but with wonderful agility he avoided
them and sprang to the side of Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Back, se&ntilde;ors!" he cried coolly and composedly,
facing their uplifted points.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Alvarado, "bid these gentlemen
withdraw their weapons. This man is under my
protection."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He I told you of, sir, who set me free, provided
Donna Mercedes with a weapon, opened the gate for
us. One Benjamin Hornigold."</p>

<p>"Thou damned traitor!" yelled that fierce, high
voice on the outskirts of the crowd.</p>

<p>There was a sudden commotion. A bound man
burst through the surprised cavaliers and threw himself,
all fettered though he was, upon the sailor. He
was without weapon or use of hand, yet he bit him
savagely on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Hell!" he cried, as they pulled him away and
dragged him to his feet, "had I a free hand for a
second you'd pay! As it is, I've marked you, and
you'll carry the traitor's brand until you die! Curse
you, whatever doom comes to me, may worse come
to you!"</p>

<p>The old buccaneer was an awful figure, as he
poured out a horrible torrent of curses and imprecations
upon the traitor, grinding his teeth beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
his foam-flecked lips, and even the iron-hearted
sailor, striving to staunch the blood, involuntarily
shrank back appalled before him.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or," he cried, appealing to Alvarado, "I was
to have protection!"</p>

<p>"You shall have it," answered the young soldier,
himself shrinking away from the traitor, although
by his treason he had so greatly benefited. "My
lord, had it not been for this man, I'd still be a
prisoner, the lady Mercedes like those wretched
women weeping in the streets. I promised him, in
your name, protection, immunity from punishment,
and liberty to depart with as much of the treasure
of the Porto Bello plate galleon, which was wrecked
on the sands a few days ago, of which I told you, as
he could carry."</p>

<p>"And you did not exceed your authority, Captain
Alvarado. We contemn treason in whatsoever guise
it doth appear, and we hate and loathe a traitor, but
thy word is passed. It will be held inviolate as
our own. You are free, knave. I will appoint
soldiers to guard you, for should my men see you,
not knowing this, they would cut you down; and
when occasion serves you may take passage in the
first ship that touches here and go where you will.
Nay, we will be generous, although we like you not.
We are much indebted to you. We have profited by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
what we do despise. We would reward you. Ask
of me something that I may measure my obligation
for a daughter's honor saved, if you can realize or
feel what that may be."</p>

<p>"My lord, hear me," said the boatswain quickly.
"There be reasons and reasons for betrayals, and I
have one. This man was my captain. I perilled my
life a dozen times to save his; I followed him blindly
upon a hundred terrible ventures; I lived but for his
service. My soul&mdash;when I had a soul&mdash;was at his
command; I loved him. Ay, gentlemen, rough, uncouth,
old though I am, I loved this man. He could
ask of me anything that I could have given him and
he would not have been refused.</p>

<p>"Sirs, there came to me a young brother of mine,
not such as I, a rude, unlettered sailor, but a gentleman&mdash;and
college bred. There are quarterings on
my family scutcheon, sirs, back in Merry England,
had I the wit or care to trace it. He was a reckless
youth, chafing under the restraints of that hard
religion to which we had been born. The free life
of a brother-of-the-coast attracted him. He became
like me, a buccaneer. I strove to dissuade him, but
without avail. He was the bravest, the handsomest,
the most gallant of us all. He came into my old
heart like a son. We are not all brute, gentlemen.
I have waded in blood and plunder like the rest, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
in every heart there is some spot that beats for
things better. I divided my love between him and
my captain. This man"&mdash;he pointed to his old
master with his blunted finger, drawing himself up
until he looked taller than he was, his one eye flashing
with anger and hatred, as with a stern, rude
eloquence he recited his wrongs, the grim indictment
of a false friend&mdash;"this man betrayed us at Panama.
With what he had robbed his comrades of he bought
immunity, even knighthood, from the King of
England. He was made Vice-Governor of Jamaica
and his hand fell heavily upon those who had blindly
followed him in the old days, men who had served
him and trusted him, as I&mdash;men whose valor and
courage had made him what he was.</p>

<p>"He took the lad I loved, and because his proud
spirit would not break to his heavy hand and he
answered him like the bold, free sailor he was, he
hanged him like a dog, sirs! I&mdash;I&mdash;stooped for his
life. I, who cared not for myself, offered to stand in
his place upon the gallows platform, though I have
no more taste for the rope than any of you, if only
he might go free. He laughed at me! He mocked
me! I urged my ancient service&mdash;he drove me from
him with curses and threats like a whipped dog. I
could have struck him down then, but that I wanted
to save him for a revenge that might measure my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
hate, slow and long and terrible. Not mere sudden
death, that would not suffice. Something more.</p>

<p>"Treachery? My lord, his was the first. I
played his own game and have overcome it with the
same. D'ye blame me now? Take your treasure!
I want none of it. I want only him and my revenge!
Liberty's dear to all of us. I'll give mine up. You
may take my life with the rest, but first give me this
man. Let me deal with him. I will revenge you all,
and when I have finished with him I will yield myself
to you."</p>

<p>He was a hideous figure of old hate and rancor, of
unslaked passion, of monstrous possibilities of cruel
torture. Hardened as they were by the customs of
their age to hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness,
the listeners turned cold at such an exhibition of
malefic passion, of consuming hatred. Even Morgan
himself, intrepid as he was, shrank from the awful
menace of the mordant words.</p>

<p>"My lord!" shouted the unfortunate captain,
"give him no heed. He lies in his throat; he lies a
thousand times. 'Twas a mutinous dog, that brother
of his, that I hanged. I am your prisoner. You are
a soldier. I look for speedy punishment, certain
death it may be, but let it not be from his hand."</p>

<p>"Think, se&ntilde;ors," urged the boatswain; "you
would hang him perhaps. It is the worst that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
could do. Is that punishment meet for him? He
has despoiled women, bereft children, tortured men,
in the streets of La Guayra. A more fitting punishment
should await him. Think of Panama, of Maracaibo,
of Porto Bello! Recall what he did there.
Is hanging enough? Give him to me. Let me
have my way. You have your daughter, safe, unharmed,
within the shelter of her lover's arms. The
town is yours. You have won the fight. 'Twas I
that did it. Without me your wives, your children,
your subjects, would have been slaughtered in Caracas
and this dog would have been free to go further
afield for prey. He coveted your daughter&mdash;would
fain make her his slave in some desert island. Give
him to me!"</p>

<p>"Old man," said the Viceroy, "I take back my
words. You have excuse for your betrayal, but
your request I can not grant. I have promised him
to Alvarado. Nay, urge me no further. My word
is passed."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you!" cried Morgan, breathing
again.</p>

<p>"Silence, you dog!" said the Viceroy, with a look
of contempt on his face. "But take heart, man," he
added, as he saw the look of rage and disappointment
sweep over the face of the old sailor, "he will
not escape lightly. Would God he had blood enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
in his body to pay drop by drop for all he hath shed.
His death shall be slow, lingering, terrible. You
have said it, and you shall see it, too, and you will.
He shall have time to repent and to think upon the
past. You may glut yourself with his suffering and
feed fat your revenge. 'Twill be a meet, a fitting
punishment so far as our poor minds can compass.
We have already planned it."</p>

<p>"You Spanish hounds!" roared Morgan stoutly,
"I am a subject of England. I demand to be sent
there for trial."</p>

<p>"You are an outlaw, sir, a man of no country, a
foe to common humanity, and taken in your crimes.
Silence, I say!" again cried the old man. "You
pollute the air with your speech. Take him away
and hold him safe. To-morrow he shall be punished."</p>

<p>"Without a trial?" screamed the old buccaneer,
struggling forward.</p>

<p>"Thou art tried already. Thou hast been weighed
in the balances and found wanting. Alvarado, art
ready for duty?"</p>

<p>"Ready, your Excellency," answered the young
man, "and for this duty."</p>

<p>"Take him then, I give him into your hands.
You know what is to be done; see you do it well."</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord. Into the strong-room with him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
men!" ordered the young Spaniard, stepping unsteadily
forward.</p>

<p>As he did so the crucifix he wore, which the disorder
in his dress exposed to view, flashed into the
light once more. Morgan's eyes fastened upon it
for the first time.</p>

<p>"By heaven, sir!" he shouted. "Where got ye
that cross?"</p>

<p>"From his mother, noble captain," interrupted
Hornigold, coming closer.</p>

<p>He had another card to play. He had waited for
this moment, and he threw back his head with a
long, bitter laugh. There was such sinister, such
vicious mockery and meaning in his voice, with not
the faintest note of merriment to relieve it, that his
listeners looked aghast upon him.</p>

<p>"His mother?" cried Morgan. "Then this
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. The assembled cavaliers, Mercedes,
and Alvarado stood with bated breath waiting for
the terrible boatswain's answer.</p>

<p>"The boy I took into Cuchillo when we were at
Panama," said Hornigold in triumph.</p>

<p>"And my son!" cried the old buccaneer with
malignant joy.</p>

<p>A great cry of repudiation and horror burst from
the lips of Alvarado. The others stared with aston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>ishment
and incredulity written on their faces. Mercedes
moved closer to her lover and strove to take
his hand.</p>

<p>"My lords and gentlemen, hear me," continued
the buccaneer, the words rushing from his lips in his
excitement, for in the new relationship he so
promptly and boldly affirmed, he thought he saw a
way of escape from his imminent peril. "There
lived in Maracaibo a Spanish woman, Maria Zerega,
who loved me. By her there was a child&mdash;mine&mdash;a
boy. I took them with me to Panama. The pestilence
raged there after the sack. She fell ill, and
as she lay dying besought me to save the boy. I
sent Hornigold to her with instructions to do her
will, and he carried the baby to the village of
Cuchillo with that cross upon his breast and left
him. We lost sight of him. There, the next day,
you found him. He has English blood in his veins.
He is my son, sirs, a noble youth," sneered the old
man. "Now you have given me to him. 'Tis not
meet that the father should suffer at the hands of
the son. You shall set me free," added the man,
turning to Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Rather than that&mdash;" cried Hornigold, viciously
springing forward knife in hand.</p>

<p>He was greatly surprised at the bold yet cunning
appeal of his former captain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>"Back, man!" interposed the Viceroy. "And
were you a thousand times his father, were you my
brother, my own father, you should, nevertheless,
die, as it hath been appointed."</p>

<p>"Can this be true?" groaned Alvarado, turning
savagely to Hornigold.</p>

<p>"I believe it to be."</p>

<p>"Why not kill me last night then?"</p>

<p>"I wanted you for this minute. 'Tis a small part
of my revenge. To see him die and by his son's
hand&mdash;A worthy father, noble son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" shouted de Lara. "Art thou without
bowels of compassion, man! Alvarado, I pity
thee, but this makes the promise of the hour void.
Nay, my daughter"&mdash;as Mercedes came forward to
entreat him&mdash;"I'd rather slay thee with my own
hand than wed thee to the son of such as yon!"</p>

<p>"My lord, 'tis just," answered Alvarado. His
anguish was pitiful to behold. "I am as innocent of
my parentage as any child, yet the suffering must
be mine. The sins of the fathers are visited on the
children. I did deem it yesterday a coward's act to
cut the thread of my life but now&mdash;I cannot survive&mdash;I
cannot live&mdash;and know that in my veins&mdash;runs
the blood of such a monster. My lord, you have
been good to me. Gentlemen, you have honored
me. Mercedes, you have loved me&mdash;O God! You,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
infamous man, you have fathered me. May the
curse of God, that God whom you mock, rest upon
you! My mother loved this man once, it seems.
Well, nobly did she expiate. I go to join her. Pray
for me. Stay not my hand. Farewell!"</p>

<p>He raised his poniard.</p>

<p>"Let no one stop him," cried the old Viceroy as
Alvarado darted the weapon straight at his own
heart. "This were the best end."</p>

<p>Mercedes had stood dazed during this conversation,
but with a shriek of horror, as she saw the flash
of the blade, she threw herself upon her lover, and
strove to wrench the dagger from him.</p>

<p>"Alvarado!" she cried, "whatever thou art, thou
hast my heart! Nay, slay me first, if thou wilt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>y, strike, Alvarado," cried the Viceroy,
filled with shame and surprise at the
sight of his daughter's extraordinary
boldness, "for though I love her, I'd
rather see her dead than
married to the son of
such as he. Drive home
your weapon!" he cried
in bitter scorn. "Why
stay your hand? Only
blood can wash out the
shame she hath put upon
me before you all this
day. Thou hast a dagger.
Use it, I say!"</p>

<p>"Do you hear my father's words, Alvarado?"
cried Mercedes sinking on her knees and stretching
up her hands to him. "'Tis a sharp weapon. One
touch will end it all, and you can follow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>"God help me!" cried the unhappy young Captain,
throwing aside the poniard and clasping his
hands to his eyes. "I cannot! Hath no one here
a point for me? If I have deserved well of you or
the State, sir, bid them strike home."</p>

<p>"Live, young sir," interrupted Morgan, "there
are other women in the world. Come with me
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you are my father, you have but little time in
this world," interrupted the Spaniard, turning to
Morgan and gnashing his teeth at him. "I doubt
not but you were cruel to my mother. I hate you!
I loathe you! I despise you for all your crimes!
And most of all for bringing me into the world. I
swear to you, had I the power, I'd not add another
moment to your life. The world were better rid of
you."</p>

<p>"You have been well trained by your Spanish
nurses," cried Morgan resolutely, although with
sneering mockery and hate in his voice, "and well
you seem to know the duty owed by son to sire."</p>

<p>"You have done nothing for me," returned the
young soldier, "you abandoned me. Such as you
are you were my father. You cast me away to
shift for myself. Had it not been for these friends
here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," said Morgan, "I thought you dead. That

<p>"Glad am I that you did not, for I have passed
my life where no child of yours could hope to be&mdash;among
honorable men, winning their respect, which
I now forfeit because of thee."</p>

<p>"Alvarado," said the Viceroy, "this much will I
do for thee. He shall be shot like a soldier instead
of undergoing the punishment we had designed for
him. This much for his fatherhood."</p>

<p>"My lord, I ask it not," answered the young man.</p>

<p>"Sir," exclaimed Morgan, a gleam of relief passing
across his features, for he knew, of course, that
death was his only expectation, and he had greatly
feared that his taking off would be accompanied by
the most horrible tortures that could be devised by
people who were not the least expert in the practice
of the unmentionable cruelties of the age, "you, at
least, are a father, and I thank you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a father and a most unhappy one,"
groaned de Lara, turning toward Alvarado. "Perhaps
it is well you did not accomplish your purpose
of self-destruction after all, my poor friend. As I
said before, Spain hath need of you. You may go
back to the old country beyond the great sea. All
here will keep your secret; my favor will be of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
service to you even there. You can make a new
career with a new name."</p>

<p>"And Mercedes?" asked Alvarado.</p>

<p>"You have no longer any right to question. Ah,
well, it is just that you should hear. The girl goes
to a convent; the only cloak for her is in our Holy
Religion&mdash;and so ends the great race of de Laras!"</p>

<p>"No, no," pleaded Mercedes, "send me not there!
Let me go with him!" She stepped nearer to him,
beautiful and beseeching. "My father," she urged,
"you love me." She threw her arms around his
neck and laid her head upon his breast. Upon it her
father tenderly pressed his hand. "You loved my
mother, did you not?" she continued. "Think of
her. Condemn me not to the living death of a convent&mdash;away
from him. If that man be his father&mdash;and
I can not believe it, there is some mistake, 'tis
impossible that anything so foul should bring into
the world a man so noble&mdash;yet I love him! You
know him. You have tried him a thousand times.
He has no qualities of his base ancestry. His mother
at least died like a Spanish gentlewoman. My lords,
gentlemen, some of you have known me from my
childhood. You have lived in our house and have
followed the fortunes of my father&mdash;you have grown
gray in our service. Intercede for me!"</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," said old Don C&aelig;sar de Agra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>monte,
a man, who, as Mercedes had said, had literally
grown gray in the service of the Viceroy, and
who was man of birth scarcely inferior to his own,
"the words of the Lady Mercedes move me profoundly.
By your grace's leave, I venture to say
that she hath spoken well and nobly, and that the
young Alvarado, whom we have seen in places that
try men's souls to the extreme, hath always comported
himself as a Spanish gentleman should. This
may be a lie. But if it is true, his old association
with you and yours, and some humor of courage and
fidelity and gentleness that I doubt not his mother
gave him, have washed out the taint. Will you not
reconsider your words? Give the maiden to the
man. I am an old soldier, sir, and have done you
some service. I would cheerfully stake my life to
maintain his honor and his gentleness at the sword's
point."</p>

<p>"He speaks well, Don Alvaro," cried Captain
Gayoso, another veteran soldier. "I join my plea
to that of my comrade, Don C&aelig;sar."</p>

<p>"And I add my word, sir."</p>

<p>"And I, mine."</p>

<p>"And I, too," came from the other men of the
suite.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I thank you," said Alvarado, gratefully
looking at the little group; "this is one sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
use of my adversity. I knew not I was so befriended&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You hear, you hear, my father, what these noble
gentlemen say?" interrupted Mercedes.</p>

<p>"But," continued Alvarado sadly, "it is not meet
that the blood of the princely de Laras should be
mingled with mine. Rather the ancient house should
fall with all its honors upon it than be kept alive by
degradation. I thank you, but it can not be."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, we humbly press you for an
answer," persisted Agramonte.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen&mdash;and you have indeed proven yourselves
generous and gentle soldiers&mdash;I appreciate
what you say. Your words touch me profoundly. I
know how you feel, but Alvarado is right. I swear
to you that I would rather let my line perish than
keep it in existence by such means. Rather anything
than that my daughter should marry&mdash;forgive
me, lad&mdash;the bastard son of a pirate and buccaneer,
a wicked monster, like that man!"</p>

<p>"Sir," exclaimed a thin, faint old voice from the
outskirts of the room, "no base blood runs in the
veins of that young man. You are all mistaken."</p>

<p>"Death and fury!" shouted Morgan, who was
nearer to him, "it is the priest! Art alive? Scuttle
me, I struck you down&mdash;I do not usually need to
give a second blow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is this?" asked de Lara. "Back, gentlemen,
and give him access to our person."</p>

<p>The excited men made way for a tall, pale, gaunt
figure of a man clad in the habit of a Dominican.
As he crossed his thin hands on his breast and bowed
low before the Viceroy, the men marked a deeply
scarred wound upon his shaven crown, a wound
recently made, for it was still raw and open. The
man tottered as he stood there.</p>

<p>"'Tis the priest!" exclaimed Hornigold, who had
been a silent and disappointed spectator of the scene
at last. "He lives then?"</p>

<p>"The good father!" said Mercedes, stepping
from her father's side and scanning the man eagerly.
"He faints! A chair for him, gentlemen, and
wine!"</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said the Viceroy as the priest seated
himself on a stool which willing hands had placed
for him, after he had partaken of a generous draught
of wine, which greatly refreshed him, "your
name?"</p>

<p>"Fra Antonio de Las Casas, your Excellency, a
Dominican, from Peru, bound for Spain on the plate
galleon, the <i>Almirante Recalde</i>, captured by that
man. I was stricken down by his blow as I administered
absolution to the mother of the young captain.
I recovered and crawled into the woods for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
concealment, and when I saw your soldiers, your
Excellency, I followed, but slowly, for I am an old
man and sore wounded."</p>

<p>"Would that my blow had bit deeper, thou false
priest!" roared Morgan in furious rage.</p>

<p>"Be still!" commanded the old Viceroy sternly.
"Speak but another word until I give you leave and
I'll have you gagged! You said strange words, Holy
Father, when you came into the hall."</p>

<p>"I did, my lord."</p>

<p>"You heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some of the conversation, sir, from which I
gathered that this unfortunate man"&mdash;pointing to
Morgan, who as one of the chief actors in the transaction
had been placed in the front rank of the
circle, although tightly bound and guarded by the
grim soldiers&mdash;"claimed to be the father of the
brave young soldier."</p>

<p>"Ay, and he hath established the claim,"
answered de Lara.</p>

<p>"Nay, my lord, that can not be."</p>

<p>"Why not, sir," interrupted Alvarado, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>"Because it is not true."</p>

<p>"Thank God, thank God!" cried Alvarado. Indeed,
he almost shouted in his relief.</p>

<p>"How know you this?" asked Mercedes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lady, gentles all, I have proof irrefutable.
He is not the child of that wicked man. His father
is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I care not who," cried Alvarado, having passed
from death unto life in the tremendous moments,
"even though he were the meanest and poorest
peasant, so he were an honest man."</p>

<p>"My lord," said the priest, "he was a noble
gentleman."</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it!" cried Mercedes. "I said
it must be so."</p>

<p>"Ay, a gentleman, a gentleman!" burst from the
officers in the room.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," continued the old man, turning
to the Viceroy. "His blood is as noble as your
own."</p>

<p>"His name?" said the old man, who had stood
unmoved in the midst of the tumult.</p>

<p>"Captain Alvarado that was," cried the Dominican,
with an inborn love of the dramatic in his
tones, "stand forth. My lord and lady, and gentles
all, I present to you Don Francisco de Guzman, the
son of his excellency, the former Governor of Panama
and of his wife, Isabella Zerega, a noble and
virtuous lady, though of humbler walk of life and
circumstance than her husband."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>"De Guzman! De Guzman!" burst forth from
the soldiers.</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" shouted Hornigold. "He is Morgan's
son. He was given to me as such. I left him
at Cuchillo. You found him, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He appealed to the Viceroy.</p>

<p>"My venerable father, with due respect to you,
sir, we require something more than your unsupported
statement to establish so great a fact," said
the Viceroy deliberately, although the sparkle in his
eyes belied his calm.</p>

<p>"Your grace speaks well," said Morgan, clutching
at his hope still.</p>

<p>"I require nothing more. I see and believe," interrupted
Mercedes.</p>

<p>"But I want proof," sternly said her father.</p>

<p>"And you shall have it," answered the priest.
"That cross he wears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As I am about to die!" exclaimed Morgan, "I
saw his mother wear it many a time, and she put it
upon his breast."</p>

<p>"Not this one, sir," said Fra Antonio, "but its
fellow. There were two sisters in the family of
Zerega. There were two crosses made, one for each.
In an evil hour the elder sister married you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We did, indeed, go through some mockery of a
ceremony," muttered Morgan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did, sir, and 'twas a legal one, for when
you won her&mdash;by what means I know not, in Maracaibo&mdash;you
married her. You were forced to do so
before you received her consent. One of my
brethren who performed the service told me the tale.
After you took her away from Maracaibo her old
father, broken hearted at her defection, sought
asylum in Panama with the remaining daughter, and
there she met the Governor, Don Francisco de Guzman.
He loved her, he wooed and won her, and at
last he married her, but secretly. She was poor
and humble by comparison with him; she had only
her beauty and her virtue for her dower, and there
were reasons why it were better the marriage should
be concealed for a while.</p>

<p>"A child was born. You were that child, sir.
Thither came this man with his bloody marauders.
In his train was his wretched wife and her own boy,
an infant, born but a short time before that of the
Governor. De Guzman sallied out to meet them and
was killed at the head of his troops. They burned
Panama and turned that beautiful city into a hell
like unto La Guayra. I found means to secrete
Isabella de Guzman and her child. The plague
raged in the town. This man's wife died. He gave
command to Hornigold to take the child away. He
consulted me, as a priest whose life he had spared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
as to what were best to do with him, and I advised
Cuchillo, but his child died with its mother before it
could be taken away.</p>

<p>"Isabella de Guzman was ill. I deemed it wise
to send her infant away. I urged her to substitute
her child for the dead body of the other, intending
to provide for its reception at Cuchillo, and she gave
her child to the sailor. In the confusion and terror
it must have been abandoned by the woman to whom
it was delivered; she, it was supposed, perished when
the buccaneers destroyed the place out of sheer wantonness
when they left Panama. I fell sick of the
fever shortly after and knew not what happened.
The poor mother was too seriously ill to do anything.
It was months ere we recovered and could
make inquiries for the child, and then it had disappeared
and we found no trace of it. You, sir,"
pointing to Hornigold, "had gone away with the
rest. There was none to tell us anything. We never
heard of it again and supposed it dead."</p>

<p>"And my child, sir priest?" cried Morgan. "What
became of it?"</p>

<p>"I buried it in the same grave with its poor
mother with the cross on its breast. May God have
mercy on their souls!"</p>

<p>"A pretty tale, indeed," sneered the buccaneer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>"It accounts in some measure for the situation,"
said the Viceroy, "but I must have further proof."</p>

<p>"Patience, noble sir, and you shall have it.
These crosses were of cunning construction. They
open to those who know the secret. There is room
in each for a small writing. Each maiden, so they
told me, put within her own cross her marriage lines.
If this cross hath not been tampered with it should
bear within its recess the attestation of the wedding
of Francisco de Guzman and Isabella Zerega."</p>

<p>"The cross hath never left my person," said Alvarado,
"since I can remember."</p>

<p>"And I can bear testimony," said the Viceroy,
"that he hath worn it constantly since a child.
Though it was large and heavy I had a superstition
that it should never leave his person. Know you the
secret of the cross?"</p>

<p>"I do, for it was shown me by the woman herself."</p>

<p>"Step nearer, Alvarado," said de Lara.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," said the aged priest, as Alvarado
came nearer him and made to take the cross from his
breast, "thou hast worn it ever there. Wear it to
the end. I can open it as thou standest."</p>

<p>He reached up to the carven cross depending from
the breast of the young man bending over him.</p>

<p>"A pretty story," sneered Morgan again, "but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
had I aught to wager, I'd offer it with heavy odds
that that cross holds the marriage lines of my wife."</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst lose, sir, for see, gentlemen,"
cried the priest, manipulating the crucifix with his
long, slender fingers and finally opening it, "the
opening! And here is a bit of parchment! Read it,
sir."</p>

<p>He handed it to the Viceroy. The old noble, lifting
it to the light, scanned the closely-written, faded
lines on the tiny scrap of delicate parchment.</p>

<p>"'Tis a certificate of marriage of&mdash;&mdash;" He
paused.</p>

<p>"Maria Zerega," said Morgan, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the old man, and his triumph
rung in his voice, "of Isabella Zerega and Francisco
de Guzman."</p>

<p>"Hell and fury!" shouted the buccaneer, "'tis a
trick!"</p>

<p>"And signed by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped again, peering at the faded, almost
illegible signature.</p>

<p>"By whom, your Excellency?" interrupted the
priest smiling.</p>

<p>"'Tis a bit faded," said the old man, holding it
nearer. "Fra&mdash;An&mdash;tonio! Was it thou?"</p>

<p>"Even so, sir. I married the mother, as I buried
her yester eve upon the sand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis a fact established," said the Viceroy, satisfied
at last. "Don Francisco de Guzman, Alvarado
that was, thy birth and legitimacy are clear and undoubted.
There by your side stands the woman you
have loved. If you wish her now I shall be honored
to call you my son."</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Alvarado, "that I am the
son of an honorable gentleman were joy enough, but
when thou givest me Donna Mercedes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned, and with a low cry the girl fled to his
arms. He drew her close to him and laid his hand
upon her head, and then he kissed her before the
assembled cavaliers, who broke into enthusiastic
shouts and cries of happy approbation.</p>

<p>"There's more evidence yet," cried the priest,
thrusting his hand into the bosom of his habit and
drawing forth a glittering object. "Sir, I took this
from the body of Sister Maria Christina, for upon
my advice she entered upon the service of the Holy
Church after her bereavement, keeping her secret,
for there was naught to be gained by its publication.
That Church she served long and well. Many sufferers
there be to whom she ministered who will rise
up and call her blessed. She killed herself upon
the sands rather than give aid and comfort to this
man and his men, or submit herself to the evil
desires of his band. Sirs, I have lived long and suf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>fered
much, and done some little service for Christ,
His Church, and His children, but I take more comfort
from the absolution that I gave her when she
cried for mercy against the sin of self-slaughter than
for any other act in my career. Here, young sir,"
said the priest, opening the locket, "are the pictures
of your father and mother. See, cavaliers, some of
you knew Don Francisco de Guzman and can recognize
him. That is his wife. She was young and had
golden hair like thine, my son, in those days. You
are the express image of her person as I recall it."</p>

<p>"My father! My mother!" cried Alvarado.
"Look, Mercedes, look your Excellency, and gentlemen,
all! But her body, worthy father?"</p>

<p>"Even as her soul hath gone out into the new
life beyond, her body was drawn out into the great
deep at the call of God&mdash;but not unblessed, se&ntilde;ors,
even as she went not unshriven, for I knelt alone by
her side, unable by my wounds and weakness to do
more service, and said the office of our Holy
Church."</p>

<p>"May God bless thee, as I bless thee!" answered
Alvarado, to give him the familiar name.</p>

<p>As he spoke he sank on his knees and pressed a
long and fervent kiss upon the worn and withered
hand of the aged man.</p>

<p>"It is not meet," said the priest, withdrawing his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
hand and laying it in blessing upon the bowed fair
head. "That which was lost is found again. Let us
rejoice and praise God for His mercy. Donna
Mercedes, gentlemen, my blessing on Se&ntilde;or de Guzman
and upon ye all. Benedicite!" he said, making
the sign of the cross.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>nd bless me also, my father," cried Mercedes,
kneeling by Alvarado's side.</p>

<p>"Most willingly, my fair daughter,"
answered the old man. "A fit helpmate
indeed thou hast shown thyself for so brave
a soldier. By your leave, your Excellency. You
will indulge an old man's desire to bless the marriage
of the son as he did that of the mother? No obstacle,
I take it, now exists to prevent this most happy
union."</p>

<p>"None," answered the Viceroy, as the young
people rose and stood before him, "and glad I am
that this happy solution of our difficulties has come
to pass."</p>

<p>"And when, sir," questioned the priest further,
"may I ask that you design&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The sooner the better," said the Viceroy smiling
grimly. "By the mass, reverend father, I'll feel
easier when he hath her in his charge!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall prove as obedient to thee as wife, Don
Francisco&mdash;&mdash;" said Mercedes with great spirit,
turning to him.</p>

<p>"Nay, call me Alvarado, sweet lady," interrupted
her lover.</p>

<p>"Alvarado then, if you wish&mdash;for it was under
that name that I first loved thee&mdash;I shall prove as
obedient a wife to thee as I was a dutiful daughter
to thee, my father."</p>

<p>"'Tis not saying o'er much," commented the
Viceroy, but smiling more kindly as he said the
words. "Nay, I'll take that back, Mercedes, or modify
it. Thou hast, indeed, been to me all that a
father could ask, until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twas my fault, your Excellency. On me be
the punishment," interrupted the lover.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt have it with Mercedes," answered
the Viceroy, laughing broadly now. "What say ye,
gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Agramonte, from his age and
rank assuming to speak for the rest, "there is not
one of us who would not give all he possessed to
stand in the young Lord de Guzman's place."</p>

<p>"Well, well," continued the old man, "when we
have restored order in the town we shall have a
wedding ceremony&mdash;say to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, ay, to-morrow, to-morrow!" cried the cavaliers.</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, there is one more thing yet to
be done," said Alvarado as soon as he could be heard.</p>

<p>"Art ever making objections, Captain Alvarado&mdash;Don
Francisco, that is. We might think you had
reluctance to the bridal," exclaimed the Viceroy in
some little surprise. "What is it now?"</p>

<p>"The punishment of this man."</p>

<p>"I gave him into your hands."</p>

<p>"By God!" shouted old Hornigold, "I wondered
if in all this fathering and mothering and sweethearting
and giving in marriage he had forgot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so. The postponement but makes it
deeper," answered Alvarado gravely. "Rest satisfied."</p>

<p>"And I shall have my revenge in full measure?"</p>

<p>"In full, in overflowing measure, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"Do you propose to shoot me?" asked the buccaneer
chieftain coolly. "Or behead me?"</p>

<p>"That were a death for an honorable soldier taken
in arms and forced to bide the consequences of his
defeat. It is not meet for you," answered Alvarado.</p>

<p>"What then? You'll not hang me? Me! A
knight of England! Sometime Governor of
Jamaica!"</p>

<p>"These titles are nothing to me. And hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
is the death we visit upon the common criminal, a
man who murders or steals, or blasphemes. Your
following may expect that. For you there is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to burn me alive, do you?"</p>

<p>"Were you simply a heretic that might be meet,
but you are worse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried the buccaneer, carried
away by the cold-blooded menace in Alvarado's
words. "Neither lead, nor steel, nor rope, nor
fire!"</p>

<p>"Neither one nor the other, sir."</p>

<p>"Is it the wheel? The rack? The thumbscrew?
Sink me, ye shall see how an Englishman can die!
Even from these I flinch not."</p>

<p>"Nor need you, from these, for none of them
shall be used," continued the young soldier, with
such calculating ferocity in his voice that in spite of
his dauntless courage and intrepidity the blood of
Morgan froze within his veins.</p>

<p>"Death and destruction!" he shouted. "What
is there left?"</p>

<p>"You shall die, se&ntilde;or, not so much by the hand of
man as by the act of God."</p>

<p>"God! I believe in none. There is no God!"</p>

<p>"That you shall see."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, my lords! I appeal to you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
save me from this man, not my son but my
nephew&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S'death, sirrah!" shouted the Viceroy, enraged
beyond measure by the allusion to any relationship,
"not a drop of your base blood pollutes his veins.
I have given you over to him. He will attend to
you."</p>

<p>"What means he to do then?"</p>

<p>"You shall see."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>The sombre, sinister, although unknown purpose
of the Spaniards had new terrors lent to it by the
utter inability of the buccaneer to foresee what was
to be his punishment. He was a man of the highest
courage, the stoutest heart, yet in that hour he was
astonied. His knees smote together; he clenched
his teeth in a vain effort to prevent their chattering.
All his devilry, his assurance, his fortitude, his
strength, seemed to leave him. He stood before
them suddenly an old, a broken man, facing a doom
portentous and terrible, without a spark of strength
or resolution left to meet it, whatever it might be.
And for the first time in his life he played the
craven, the coward. He moistened his dry lips and
looked eagerly from one face to another in the dark
and gloomy ring that encircled him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lady," he said at last, turning to Mercedes as
the most likely of his enemies to befriend him,
"you are a woman. You should be tender hearted.
You don't want to see an old man, old enough to be
your father, suffer some unknown, awful torture?
Plead for me! Ask your lover. He will refuse
you nothing now."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence in the room. Mercedes
stared at the miserable wretch making his despairing
appeal as if she were fascinated.</p>

<p>"Answer him," said her stern old father, "as a
Spanish gentlewoman should."</p>

<p>It was a grim and terrible age. The gospel under
which all lived in those days was not that of the
present. It was a gospel writ in blood, and fire, and
steel.</p>

<p>"An eye for an eye," said the girl slowly, "a
tooth for a tooth, life for life, shame for shame,"
her voice rising until it rang through the room. "In
the name of my ruined sisters, whose wails come to
us this instant from without, borne hither on the
night wind, I refuse to intercede for you, monster.
For myself, the insults you have put upon me, I
might forgive, but not the rest. The taking of one
life like yours can not repay."</p>

<p>"You hear?" cried Alvarado. "Take him
away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p>"One moment," cried Morgan. "Holy Father&mdash;your
religion&mdash;it teaches to forgive they say. Intercede
for me!"</p>

<p>His eyes turned with faint hope toward the aged
priest.</p>

<p>"Not for such as thou," answered the old man
looking from him. "I could forgive this," he
touched his battered tonsure, "and all thou hast
done against me and mine. That is not little, for
when I was a lad, a youth, before I took the priestly
yoke upon me, I loved Maria Zerega&mdash;but that is
nothing. What suffering comes upon me I can bear,
but thou hast filled the cup of iniquity and must
drain it to the dregs. Hark ye&mdash;the weeping of the
desolated town! I can not interfere! They that
take the sword shall perish by it. It is so decreed.
You believe not in God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will! I do!" cried the buccaneer, clutching
at the hope.</p>

<p>"I shall pray for thee, that is all."</p>

<p>"Hornigold," cried the now almost frenzied man,
his voice hoarse with terror and weakness, "they
owe much to you. Without you they had not been
here. I have wronged you grievously&mdash;terribly&mdash;but
I atone by this. Beg them, not to let me go but
only to kill me where I stand! They will not refuse
you. Had it not been for you this man would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
have known his father. He could not have won this
woman. You have power. You'll not desert an old
comrade in his extremity? Think, we have stood
together sword in hand and fought our way through
all obstacles in many a desperate strait. Thou and
I, old shipmate. By the memory of that old association,
by the love you once bore me, and by that I
gave to you, ask them for my death, here&mdash;now&mdash;at
once!"</p>

<p>"You ask for grace from me!" snarled Hornigold
savagely, yet triumphant. "You&mdash;you hanged
my brother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know! 'Twas a grievous error. I
shall be punished for all&mdash;ask them to shoot me&mdash;hang
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He slipped to his knees, threw himself upon the
floor, and lay grovelling at Hornigold's feet.</p>

<p>"Don't let them torture me, man! My God,
what is it they intend to do to me?"</p>

<p>"Beg, you hound!" cried the boatswain, spurning
him with his foot. "I have you where I swore
I'd bring you. And, remember, 'tis I that laid you
low&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" He shrieked like a maniac. "When
you suffer in that living death for which they design
you, remember with every lingering breath of
anguish that it was I who brought you there! You
trifled with me&mdash;mocked me&mdash;betrayed me. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
denied my request. I grovelled at your feet and
begged you&mdash;you spurned me as I do you now.
Curse you! I'll ask no mercy for you!"</p>

<p>"My lord," gasped out Morgan, turning to the
Viceroy in one final appeal, as two of the men
dragged him to his feet again, "I have treasure.
The galleon we captured&mdash;it is buried&mdash;I can lead
you there."</p>

<p>"There is not a man of your following," said the
Viceroy, "who would not gladly purchase life by
the same means."</p>

<p>"And 'tis not needed," said the boatswain, "for
I have told them where it lies."</p>

<p>"If Teach were here," said Morgan, "he would
stand by me."</p>

<p>A man forced his way into the circle carrying a
sack in his hand. Drawing the strings he threw
the contents at the feet of the buccaneer, and there
rolled before him the severed head of the only man
save Black Dog upon whom he could have depended,
his solitary friend.</p>

<p>Morgan staggered back in horror from the ghastly
object, staring at it as if fascinated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;">

<span class="caption">... he threw the contents at the feet of the buccaneer,

</div>

<p>"Ha, ha! Ho, ho!" laughed the old boatswain.
"What was it that he sang? 'We'll be damnably
mouldy'&mdash;ay, even you and I captain&mdash;'an hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 412-414]</a></span>years hence.' But should you live so long, you'll
not forget 'twas I."</p>

<p>"You didn't betray me then, my young comrade,"
whispered Morgan, looking down at the
severed head. "You fought until you were killed.
Would that my head might lie by your side."</p>

<p>He had been grovelling, pleading, weeping, beseeching,
but the utter uselessness of it at last came
upon him and some of his courage returned. He
faced them once more with head uplifted.</p>

<p>"At your will, I'm ready," he cried. "I defy
you! You shall see how Harry Morgan can die.
Scuttle me, I'll not give way again!"</p>

<p>"Take him away," said Alvarado; "we'll attend
to him in the morning."</p>

<p>"Wait! Give me leave, since I am now tried and
condemned, to say a word."</p>

<p>A cunning plan had flashed into the mind of Morgan,
and he resolved to put it in execution.</p>

<p>"It has been a long life, mine, and a merry one.
There's more blood upon my hands&mdash;Spanish blood,
gentlemen&mdash;than upon those of any other human
being. There was Puerto Principe. Were any of
you there? The men ran like dogs before me there
and left the women and children. I wiped my feet
upon your accursed Spanish flag. I washed the
blood from my hands with hair torn from the heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
of your wives, your sweethearts, and you had not
courage to defend them!"</p>

<p>A low murmur of rage swept through the room.</p>

<p>"But that's not all. Some of you perhaps were at
Porto Bello. I drove the women of the convents to
the attack, as in this city yesterday. When I finished
I burned the town&mdash;it made a hot fire. I did
it&mdash;I&mdash;who stand here! I and that cursed one-eyed
traitor Hornigold, there!"</p>

<p>The room was in a tumult now. Shouts, and
curses, and imprecations broke forth. Weapons
were bared, raised, and shaken at him. The buccaneer
laughed and sneered, ineffable contempt pictured
on his face.</p>

<p>"And some of you were at Santa Clara, at
Chagres, and here in Venezuela at Maracaibo, where
we sunk the ships and burned your men up like
rats. Then, there was Panama. We left the men to
starve and die. Your mother, Se&ntilde;or Agramonte&mdash;what
became of her? Your sister, there! Your
wife, here! The sister of your mother, you young
dog&mdash;what became of them all? Hell was let loose
in this town yesterday. Panama was worse than La
Guayra. I did it&mdash;I&mdash;Harry Morgan's way!"</p>

<p>He thrust himself into the very faces of the men,
and with cries of rage they rushed upon him. They
brushed aside the old Viceroy, drowning his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>mands
with their shouts. Had it not been for the
interference of Hornigold and Alvarado they would
have cut Morgan to pieces where he stood. And this
had been his aim&mdash;to provoke them beyond measure
by a recital of some of his crimes so that he
would be killed in their fury. But the old boatswain
with superhuman strength seized the bound
captain and forced him into a corner behind a table,
while Alvarado with lightning resolution beat down
the menacing sword points.</p>

<p>"Back!" he cried. "Do you not see he wished
to provoke this to escape just punishment? I would
have silenced him instantly but I thought ye could
control yourselves. I let him rave on that he might
be condemned out of his own mouth, that none could
have doubt that he merits death at our hands to-morrow.
Sheath your weapons instantly, gentlemen!"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Ay," said the Viceroy, stepping into the crowd
and endeavoring to make himself heard, "under
pain of my displeasure. What, soldiers, nobles, do
ye turn executioners in this way?"</p>

<p>"My mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The women and children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The insult to the flag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The disgrace to the Spanish name!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p>"That he should say these things and live!"</p>

<p>"Peace, sirs, he will not say words like these
to-morrow. Now, we have had enough. See!"
cried the old Viceroy, pointing to the windows, "the
day breaks. Take him away. Agramonte, to you
I commit the fort. Mercedes, Alvarado, come with
me. Those who have no duties to perform, go get
some sleep. As for you, prisoner, if you have preparation
to make, do so at once, for in the morning
you shall have no opportunity."</p>

<p>"I am ready now!" cried Morgan recklessly,
furious because he had been balked in his attempt.
"Do with me as you will! I have had my day, and
it has been a long and merry one."</p>

<p>"And I mine, to-night. It has been short, but
enough," laughed Hornigold, his voice ringing like
a maniac's in the hall. "For I have had my
revenge!"</p>

<p>"We shall take care of that in the morning," said
Alvarado, turning away to follow the Viceroy and
Mercedes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>efore it was submerged by the great
earthquake which so tremendously
overwhelmed the shores of South
America with appalling disaster nearly
a century and a half later, a great arid rock on an
encircling stretch of sandy beach&mdash;resultant of untold
centuries of struggle between stone and sea&mdash;thrust
itself above the waters a few miles northward
of the coast of Venezuela. The cay was barren and
devoid of any sort of life except for a single clump
of bushes that had sprung up a short distance from
the huge rock upon a little plateau sufficiently elevated
to resist the attacks of the sea, which at high
tide completely overflowed the islet except at that
one spot.</p>

<p>Four heavy iron staples had been driven with
great difficulty into holes drilled in the face of the
volcanic rock. To these four large chains had been
made fast. The four chains ended in four fetters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
and the four fetters enclosed the ankles and wrists of
a man. The length of the four chains had been so
cunningly calculated that the arms and legs of the
man were drawn far apart, so that he resembled a
gigantic white cross against the dark surface of the
stone. A sailor would have described his position
by saying that he had been "spread-eagled" by
those who had fastened him there. Yet the chains
were not too short to allow a little freedom of motion.
He could incline to one side or to the other,
lift himself up or down a little, or even thrust himself
slightly away from the face of the rock.</p>

<p>The man was in tatters, for his clothing had been
rent and torn by the violent struggles he had made
before he had been securely fastened in his chains.
He was an old man, and his long gray hair fell on
either side of his lean, fierce face in tangled masses.
A strange terror of death&mdash;the certain fate that
menaced him, was upon his countenance. He had
borne himself bravely enough except for a few
craven moments, while in the presence of his captors
and judges, chief among whom had been the young
Spanish soldier and the one-eyed sailor whom he had
known for so many years. With the bravado of
despair he had looked with seeming indifference on
the sufferings of his own men that same morning.
After being submitted to the tortures of the rack,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
the boot, the thumbscrew, or the wheel, in accordance
with the fancy of their relentless captors, they
had been hanged to the outer walls and he had been
forced to pass by them on his way to this hellish
spot. But the real courage of the man was gone now.
His simulation had not even been good enough to
deceive his enemies, and now even that had left him.</p>

<p>He was alone, so he believed, upon the island, and
all of the mortal fear slowly creeping upon him
already appeared in his awful face, clearly exhibited
by the light of the setting sun streaming upon his
left hand for he was chained facing northward, that
is, seaward. As he fancied himself the only living
thing upon that island he took little care to conceal
his emotions&mdash;indeed, it was impossible for him any
longer to keep up the pretence of indifference. His
nerves were shattered, his spirit broken. Retribution
was dogging him hard. Vengeance was close
at hand at last. Besides, what mattered it? He
thought himself alone, absolutely alone. But in that
fancy he was wrong, for in the solitary little copse
of bushes of which mention has been made there lay
hidden a man&mdash;an ancient sailor. His single eye
gleamed as fiercely upon the bound, shackled prisoner
as did the setting sun itself.</p>

<p>Old Benjamin Hornigold, who had schemed and
planned for his revenge, had insisted upon being put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
ashore on the other side of the island after the boats
had rowed out of sight of the captive, that he might
steal back and, himself unseen, watch the torture of
the man who had betrayed him and wronged him so
deeply that in his diseased mind no expiation could
be too awful for the crime; that he might glut his
fierce old soul with the sight for which it had longed
since the day Harry Morgan, beholden to him as he
was for his very life and fortune, for a thousand
brave and faithful, if nefarious, services, had driven
him like a dog from his presence. Alvarado&mdash;who,
being a Spaniard, could sympathize and understand
the old sailor's lust for revenge&mdash;had readily complied
with his request, and had further promised to
return for the boatswain in two days. They calculated
nicely that the already exhausted prisoner
would scarcely survive that long, and provisions and
water ample for that period had been left for the
sustenance of Hornigold&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Morgan, however, did not know this. He believed
his only companions to be the body of the half-breed
who had died for him as he had lived for him, and
the severed head of a newer comrade who had not
betrayed him. The body lay almost at his feet; the
head had been wedged in the sand so that its sightless
face was turned toward him in the dreadful, lidless
staring gaze of sudden death. And those two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
were companions with whom he could better have
dispensed, even in his solitude.</p>

<p>They had said to the buccaneer, as they fastened
him to the rocks, that they would not take his life,
but that he would be left to the judgment of God.
What would that be? He thought he knew.</p>

<p>He had lived long enough on the Caribbean to
know the habits of that beautiful and cruel sea.
There was a little stretch of sand at his feet and then
the water began. He estimated that the tide had
been ebbing for an hour or so when he was fastened
up and abandoned. The rock to which he had been
chained was still wet, and he noticed that the dampness
existed far above his head. The water would
recede&mdash;and recede&mdash;and recede&mdash;until perhaps
some three hundred feet of bare sand would stretch
before him, and then it would turn and come back,
back, back. Where would it stop? How high would
it rise? Would it flood in in peaceful calm as it was
then drawing away? Would it come crashing in
heavy assault upon the sands as it generally did,
beating out his life against the rock? He could not
tell. He gazed at it intently so long as there was
light, endeavoring to decide the momentous question.
To watch it was something to do. It gave him
mental occupation, and so he stared and stared at the
slowly withdrawing water-line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the two he thought he should prefer a storm.
He would be beaten to pieces, the life battered out of
him horribly in that event; but that would be a
battle, a struggle,&mdash;action. He could fight, if he
could not wait and endure. It would be a terrible
death, but it would be soon over and, therefore, he
preferred it to the slow horror of watching the approach
of the waters creeping in and up to drown
him. The chief agony of his position, however, the
most terrifying feature in this dreadful situation to
which his years of crime had at last brought him,
was that he was allowed no choice. He had always
been a man of swift, prompt, bold action; self-reliant,
fearless, resolute, a master not a server;
accustomed to determine events in accordance with
his own imperious will, and wont to bring them
about as he planned. To be chained there, impotent,
helpless, waiting, indeed, the judgment of God, was
a thing which it seemed impossible for him to bear.
The indecision of it, the uncertainty of it, added to
his helplessness and made it the more appalling to
him.</p>

<p>The judgment of God! He had never believed
in a God since his boyhood days, and he strove to
continue in his faithlessness now. He had been a
brave man, dauntless and intrepid, but cold, par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>alyzing
fear now gripped him by the heart. A few
lingering sparks of the manhood and courage of the
past that not even his crimes had deprived him of
still remained in his being, however, and he strove
as best he might to control the beating of his heart,
to still the trembling of his arms and legs which
shook the chains against the stone face of the rock
making them ring out in a faint metallic clinking,
which was the sweetest music that had ever pierced
the eager hollow of the ear of the silent listener and
watcher concealed in the thicket.</p>

<p>So long as it was light Morgan intently watched
the sea. There was a sense of companionship in it
which helped to alleviate his unutterable loneliness.
And he was a man to whom loneliness in itself was
a punishment. There were too many things in the
past that had a habit of making their presence felt
when he was alone, for him ever to desire to be
solitary. Presently the sun disappeared with the
startling suddenness of tropic latitudes, and without
twilight darkness fell over the sea and over his haggard
face like a veil. The moon had not yet risen
and he could see nothing. There were a few faint
clouds on the horizon, he had noticed, which might
presage a storm. It was very dark and very still, as
calm and peaceful a tropic night as ever shrouded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
the Caribbean. Farther and farther away from him
he could hear the rustle of the receding waves as the
tide went down. Over his head twinkled the stars
out of the deep darkness.</p>

<p>In that vast silence he seemed to hear a voice, still
and small, talking to him in a faint whisper that yet
pierced the very centre of his being. All that it
said was one word repeated over and over again,
"God&mdash;God&mdash;God!" The low whisper beat into
his brain and began to grow there, rising louder and
louder in its iteration until the whole vaulted heaven
throbbed with the ringing sound of it. He listened&mdash;listened&mdash;it
seemed for hours&mdash;until his heart
burst within him. At last he screamed and
screamed, again and again, "Yes&mdash;yes! Now I
know&mdash;I know!" And still the sound beat on.</p>

<p>He saw strange shapes in the darkness. One that
rose and rose, and grew and grew, embracing all the
others until its head seemed to touch the stars, and
ever it spoke that single word "God&mdash;God&mdash;God!"
He could not close his eyes, but if he had been able
to raise his hand he would have hid his face. The
wind blew softly, it was warm and tender, yet the
man shivered with cold, the sweat beaded his brow.</p>

<p>Then the moon sprang up as suddenly as the sun
had fallen. Her silver radiance flooded the firma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>ment.
Light, heavenly light once more! He was
alone. The voice was still; the shadow left him.
Far away from him the white line of the water was
breaking on the silver sand. His own cry came back
to him and frightened him in the dead silence.</p>

<p>Now the tide turned and came creeping in. It
had gone out slowly; it had lingered as if reluctant
to leave him; but to his distraught vision it returned
with the swiftness of a thousand white horses tossing
their wind-blown manes. The wind died down; the
clouds were dissipated. The night was so very calm,
it mocked the storm raging in his soul. And still the
silvered water came flooding in; gently&mdash;tenderly&mdash;caressingly&mdash;the
little waves lapped the sands. At
last they lifted the ghastly head of young Teach&mdash;he'd
be damnably mouldy a hundred years hence!&mdash;and
laid it at his feet.</p>

<p>He cursed the rising water, and bade it stay&mdash;and
heedlessly it came on. It was a tropic sea and
the waters were as warm as those of any sun-kissed
ocean, but they broke upon his knees with the coldness
of eternal ice. They rolled the heavier body of
his faithful slave against him&mdash;he strove to drive it
away with his foot as he had striven to thrust aside
the ghastly head, and without avail. The two
friends receded as the waves rolled back but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
came on again, and again, and again. They had
been faithful to him in life, they remained with him
in death.</p>

<p>Now the water broke about his waist; now it rose
to his breast. He was exhausted; worn out. He
hung silent, staring. His mind was busy; his
thought went back to that rugged Welsh land where
he had been born. He saw himself a little boy playing
in the fields that surrounded the farmhouse of
his father and mother.</p>

<p>He took again that long trip across the ocean. He
lived again in the hot hell of the Caribbean. Old
forms of forgotten buccaneers clustered about him.
Mansfelt, under whom he had first become prominent
himself. There on the horizon rose the walls of a
sleeping town. With his companions he slowly crept
forward through the underbrush, slinking along like
a tiger about to spring upon its prey. The doomed
town flamed before his eyes. The shrieks of men,
the prayers of women, the piteous cries of little
children came into his ears across forty years.</p>

<p>Cannon roared in his ear&mdash;the crash of splintered
wood, the despairing appeals for mercy, for help,
from drowning mariners, as he stood upon a bloody
deck watching the rolling of a shattered, sinking
ship. Was that water, spray from some tossing
wave, or blood, upon his hand?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>The water was higher now; it was at his neck.
There were Porto Bello, Puerto Principe, and Maracaibo,
and Chagres and Panama&mdash;ah, Panama! All
the fiends of hell had been there, and he had been
their chief! They came back now to mock him.
They pointed at him, gibbered upon him, threatened
him, and laughed&mdash;great God, how they laughed!</p>

<p>There was pale-faced, tender-eyed Maria Zerega
who had died of the plague, and the baby, the boy.
Jamaica, too, swept into his vision. There was his
wife shrinking away from him in the very articles of
death. There was young Ebenezer Hornigold,
dancing right merrily upon the gallows together with
others of the buccaneers he had hanged.</p>

<p>The grim figure of the one-eyed boatswain rose
before him and leered upon him and swept the other
apparitions away. This was La Guayra&mdash;yesterday.
He had been betrayed. Whose men were those? The
men hanging on the walls? And Hornigold had done
it&mdash;old Ben Hornigold&mdash;that he thought so faithful.</p>

<p>He screamed aloud again with hate, he called
down curses upon the head of the growing one-eyed
apparition. And the water broke into his mouth and
stopped him. It called him to his senses for a
moment. His present peril overcame the hideous
recollection of the past. That water was rising still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
Great God! At last he prayed. Lips that had only
cursed shaped themselves into futile petitions. There
was a God, after all.</p>

<p>The end was upon him, yet with the old instinct
of life he lifted himself upon his toes. He raised his
arms as far as the chains gave him play and caught
the chains themselves and strove to pull, to lift, at
last only to hold himself up, a rigid, awful figure.
He gained an inch or two, but his fetters held him
down. As the water supported him he found little
difficulty in maintaining the position for a space.
But he could go no higher&mdash;if the water rose an inch
more that would be the end. He could breathe only
between the breaking waves now.</p>

<p>The body of the black was swung against him
again and again; the head of young Teach kissed
him upon the cheek; and still the water seemed to
rise, and rise, and rise. He was a dead man like the
other two, indeed he prayed to die, and yet in fear
he clung to the chains and held on. Each moment
he fancied would be his last. But he could not let
go. Oh, God! how he prayed for a storm; that one
fierce wave might batter him to pieces; but the
waters were never more calm than on that long, still
night, the sea never more peaceful than in those
awful hours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by the waters fell. He could not believe
it at first. He still hung suspended and waited with
bated breath. Was he deceived? No, the waters
were surely falling. The seconds seemed minutes to
him, the minutes, hours. At last he gained assurance.
There was no doubt but that the tide was
going down. The waves had risen far, but he had
been lifted above them; now they were falling, falling!
Yes, and they were bearing away that accursed
body and that ghastly head. He was alive still,
saved for the time being. The highest waves only
touched his breast now. Lower&mdash;lower&mdash;they moved
away. Reluctantly they lingered; but they fell,
they fell.</p>

<p>To drown? That was not the judgment of God
for him then. What would it be? His head fell
forward on his breast&mdash;he had fainted in the sudden
relief of his undesired salvation.</p>

<p>Long time he hung there and still the tide ebbed
away, carrying with it all that was left of the only
two who had loved him. He was alone now, surely,
save for that watcher in the bushes. After a while
consciousness returned to him again, and after the
first swift sense of relief there came to him a deeper
terror, for he had gone through the horror and anguish
of death and had not died. He was alive still,
but as helpless as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>What had the Power he had mocked designed for
his end? Was he to watch that ghastly tide come in
again and rise, and rise, and rise until it caught him
by the throat and threatened to choke him, only to
release him as before? Was he to go through that
daily torture until he starved or died of thirst? He
had not had a bite to eat, a drop to drink, since the
day before.</p>

<p>It was morning now. On his right hand the sun
sprang from the ocean bed with the same swiftness
with which it had departed the night before.
Like the tide, it, too, rose, and rose. There
was not a cloud to temper the fierceness with which
it beat upon his head, not a breath of air to blow
across his fevered brow. The blinding rays struck
him like hammers of molten iron. He stared at it
out of his frenzied, blood-shot eyes and writhed beneath
its blazing heat. Before him the white sand
burned like smelted silver, beyond him the tremulous
ocean seemed to seethe and bubble under the furious
fire of the glowing heaven above his head&mdash;a vault
of flaming topaz over a sapphire sea.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, but could not shut out the
sight&mdash;and then the dreams of night came on him
again. His terrors were more real, more apparent,
more appalling, because he saw his dreaded visions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
in the full light of day. By and by these faded as
the others had done. All his faculties were merged
into one consuming desire for water&mdash;water. The
thirst was intolerable. Unless he could get some his
brain would give way. He was dying, dying, dying!
Oh, God, he could not die, he was not ready to die!
Oh, for one moment of time, for one drop of water&mdash;God&mdash;God&mdash;God!</p>

<p>Suddenly before his eyes there arose a figure. At
first he fancied it was another of the apparitions
which had companied with him during the awful
night and morning; but this was a human figure, an
old man, bent, haggard like himself with watching,
but with a fierce mad joy in his face. Where had he
come from? Who was he? What did he want? The
figure glared upon the unhappy man with one fiery
eye, and then he lifted before the captive's distorted
vision something&mdash;what was it&mdash;a cup of
water? Water&mdash;God in heaven&mdash;water brimming
over the cup! It was just out of reach of his lips&mdash;so
cool, so sweet, so inviting! He strained at his
chains, bent his head, thrust his lips out. He could
almost touch it&mdash;not quite! He struggled and
struggled and strove to break his fetters, but without
avail. Those fetters could not be broken by the
hand of man. He could not drink&mdash;ah, God!&mdash;then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
he lifted his blinded eyes and searched the face of
the other.</p>

<p>"Hornigold!" he whispered hoarsely with his
parched and stiffened lips. "Is it thou?"</p>

<p>A deep voice beat into his consciousness.</p>

<p>"Ay. I wanted to let you know there was water
here. You must be thirsty. You'd like a drink? So
would I. There is not enough for both of us. Who
will get it? I. Look!"</p>

<p>"Not all, not all!" screamed the old captain
faintly, as the other drained the cup. "A little! A
drop for me!"</p>

<p>"Not one drop," answered Hornigold, "not one
drop! If you were in hell and I held a river in
my hand, you would not get a drop! It's gone."</p>

<p>He threw the cup from him.</p>

<p>"I brought you to this&mdash;I! Do you recall it?
You owe this to me. You had your revenge&mdash;this
is mine. But it's not over yet. I'm watching you.
I shall not come out here again, but I'm watching
you, remember that! I can see you!"</p>

<p>"Hornigold, for God's sake, have pity!"</p>

<p>"You know no God; you have often boasted of it&mdash;neither
do I. And you never knew pity&mdash;neither
do I!"</p>

<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span></p>
<p>"Take that knife you bear&mdash;kill me!"</p>

<p> I don't want you to die&mdash;not yet. I want you to
live&mdash;live&mdash;a long time, and remember!"</p>

<p>"Hornigold, I'll make amends! I'll be your
slave!"</p>

<p>"Ay, crawl and cringe now, you dog! I swore
that you should do it! It's useless to beg me for
mercy. I know not that word&mdash;neither did you.
There is nothing left in me but hate&mdash;hate for you.
I want to see you suffer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tide! It's coming back. I can't endure
this heat and thirst! It won't drown me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Live, then," said the boatswain. "Remember,
I watch!"</p>

<p>He threw his glance upward, stopped suddenly, a
fierce light in that old eye of his.</p>

<p>"Look up," he cried, "and you will see! Take
heart, man. I guess you won't have to wait for the
tide, and the sun won't bother you long. Remember,
I am watching you!"</p>

<p>He turned and walked away, concealing himself
in the copse once more where he could see and not
be seen. The realization that he was watched by
one whom he could not see, one who gloated over his
miseries and sufferings and agonies, added the last
touch to the torture of the buccaneer. He had no
longer strength nor manhood, he no longer cried out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
after that one last appeal to the merciless sailor.
He did not even look up in obedience to the old man's
injunction. What was there above him, beneath
him, around him, that could add to his fear? He
prayed for death. They were the first and last
prayers that had fallen from his lips for fifty years,
those that day. Yet when death did come at last he
shrank from it with an increasing terror and horror
that made all that he had passed through seem like a
trifle.</p>

<p>When old Hornigold had looked up he had seen a
speck in the vaulted heaven. It was slowly soaring
around and around in vast circles, and with each
circle coming nearer and nearer to the ground. A
pair of keen and powerful eyes were aloft there
piercing the distance, looking, searching, in every
direction, until at last their glance fell upon the
figure upon the rock. The circling stopped. There
was a swift rush through the air. A black feathered
body passed between the buccaneer and the sun,
and a mighty vulture, hideous bird of the tropics,
alighted on the sands near by him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/033.jpg" width="368" height="600" alt="Hell had no terror like to this, which he, living, suffered." title="" />
<span class="caption">Hell had no terror like to this, which he, living, suffered.</span>
</div>

<p>So this was the judgment of God upon this man!
For a second his tortured heart stopped its beating.
He stared at the unclean thing, and then he shrank
back against the rock and screamed with frantic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 440-442]</a></span>terror. The bird moved heavily back a little distance
and stopped, peering at him. He could see it
by turning his head. He could drive it no farther.
In another moment there was another rush through
the air, another, another! He screamed again. Still
they came, until it seemed as if the earth and the
heavens were black with the horrible birds. High
in the air they had seen the first one swooping to the
earth, and with unerring instinct, as was their habit,
had turned and made for the point from which the
first had dropped downward to the shore.</p>

<p>They circled themselves about him. They sat
upon the rock above him. They stared at him with
their lustful, carrion, jeweled eyes out of their loathsome,
featherless, naked heads, drawing nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;nearer.
He could do no more. His voice
was gone. His strength was gone. He closed his
eyes, but the sight was still before him. His bleeding,
foamy lips mumbled one unavailing word:</p>

<p>"Hornigold!"</p>

<p>From the copse there came no sound, no answer.
He sank forward in his chains, his head upon his
breast, convulsive shudders alone proclaiming faltering
life. Hell had no terror like to this which he,
living, suffered.</p>

<p>There was a weight upon his shoulder now fierce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
talons sank deep into his quivering flesh. In front
of his face, before a pair of lidless eyes that glowed
like fire, a hellish, cruel beak struck at him. A faint,
low, ghastly cry trembled through the still air.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And the resistless tide came in. A man drove
away the birds at last before they had quite taken
all, for the torn arms still hung in the iron fetters;
an old man, blind of one eye, the black patch torn off
the hideous hole that had replaced the socket. He
capered with the nimbleness of youth before the
ghastly remains of humanity still fastened to that
rock. He shouted and screamed, and laughed and
sang. The sight had been too horrible even for him.
He was mad, crazy; his mind was gone. He had his
revenge, and it had eaten him up.</p>

<p>The waters dashed, about his feet and seemed to
awaken some new idea in his disordered brain.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, "the tide is in. Up anchor,
lads! We must beat out to sea. Captain, I'll follow
you. Harry Morgan's way to lead&mdash;old Ben Hornigold's
to follow&mdash;ha, ha! ho, ho!"</p>

<p>He waded out into the water, slowly going deeper
and deeper. A wave swept him off his feet. A
hideous laugh came floating back over the sea, and
then he struck out, and out, and out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And so the judgment of God was visited upon Sir
Henry Morgan and his men at last, and as it was
writ of old:</p>

<p><i>With what measure they had meted out, it had been
measured back to them again!</i></p>
